\begin{abstract}
Motivated by recent concerns about over-indebtedness and consumer protection
in microfinance and mortgage lending, this paper presents a model of lending
and refinance to hyperbolic discounters. First, we identify a problem of
consumer protection that survives even when consumers are sophisticated and
fully informed: a borrower would like to commit her future selves to a pattern
of repayments, but her future selves can be tempted to pay to defer debt
obligations via subsequent loan or refinancing offers. Investor-led banks may
find it costlier to credibly promise to enforce the commitment contract as has
an ex-post profit incentive to renegotiate its terms, limiting the amount of
commitment that can be offered in equilibrium. Second, we show how non-profit
and hybrid ownership (e.g. client or social investor-dominated)\ banks may
offer improved commitment. As organizations that face legal or governance
constraints that limit or bar these banks from distributing profits to outside
investors, they have a weaker incentive to renegotiate contracts, allowing
them to offer stronger commitment, ex-ante. Third, we show how a bank's
strategic choice to adopt non-profit or hybrid status depends on market
structure. A monopolist faces a trade-off: as a non-profit, it may earn higher
profits by providing superior commitment, but its ability to enjoy these
profits is restricted. Under competition, the trade-off disappears. If
contracts are exclusive, competition drives banks to adopt non-distribution
constraints. If contracts are not exclusive, for-profit banks will exist in
equilibrium and make superior commitment infeasible. The model helps explain
some stylized historical facts in consumer banking and recent developments in
microfinance. JEL Codes: O16, D03, D18\vfill

\section{Introduction}

This paper analyzes financial equilibrium lending contracts and intermediary
ownership forms in markets with hyperbolic discounters. We draw attention to
the demand for commitment in multi-period lending contracts, demonstrating
that there are circumstances where non-profit lenders -- or more broadly,
lenders that have chosen ownership/governance structures that place limits on
profit distribution -- can offer more effective and credible commitment
contracts than investor-led for-profit banks. A financial intermediary's
strategic choice to operate as a commercial non-profit or transform itself
into an investor-led for-profit firm depends on several factors, including the
extent of market competition, its ability to enforce exclusive contracts, and
the legal framework governing non-profits.

The model helps frame explanations for some important stylized facts about the
the operation of credit markets, including broad trends in the evolution of
ownership forms and issues of consumer protection in microfinance today, the
historical transformation of consumer finance in developed countries, and
consumer protection issues in mortgage refinance lending. \ In particular, the
model suggests a way to reconcile the following phenomena: the ubiquity and
persistence of non-profit and social-investor led firms in microfinance, and
the more recent growth of for-profit microfinance and its apparent association
with rising borrower `over-indebtedness' in some countries.

In recent years, especially in light of crises in consumer credit markets,
there has been renewed emphasis on consumer protection and better governance
and regulation in banking.\footnote{%DIF < 
In the US, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau was set up in 2011 under the Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act. In India, the far-reaching Micro Finance
Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill of 2012 was designed to
increase government oversight of MFIs in response to the credit crisis in the
state of Andhra Pradesh, and the perception that lax consumer protection and
agressive lending practices had led to rising over-indebtedness and stress.}
One particular area of concern has been borrower over-indebtedness, an issue
that has been at the center of recent microfinance repayment crises in places
as far-flung as Morrocco, Bosnia, Nicaragua and India. Commenting upon the
largest of these crises in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, veteran
microfiance analyst Elizabeth Rhyne (2010) describes the build up of "rising
debt stress among possibly tens of thousands of clients, brought on by
explosive growth of microfinance organizations...\textquotedblright\ fueled by
the rapid inflow of directed private lending and new equity investors who,
because they \textquotedblleft paid dearly for shares in [newly privatized]
MFIs...\ needed fast growth to make their investments pay
off.\textquotedblright\ \ Her analysis, like that of many others ultimately
lays the blame on \textquotedblleft poor governance
structures.\textquotedblright\ \ Not too dissimilar descriptions have been
given to describe the build up to the 2008 mortgage lending crisis in the
United\ States. \ In each of these cases the issue of refinancings and/or the
taking of loans from multiple lenders emerges. For example, by value, more
than two-thirds of the subprime mortgage loans outstanding in 2008 were made
up of refinanced loans (Demyank and Van Hemert, 2009).

Journalistic and scholarly analyses of such situations, including the recent
mortgage crisis in the United States, have often framed the issues as problems
of consumer protection, suggesting that many lenders designed products to
purposefully take advantage of borrowers who have limited financial literacy
skills and are naive about their self-control problems. Informed by such
interpretations, new regulations introduced in the wake of these crises have
swung toward restricting the terms of allowable contracts, for example by
setting maximum interest rates, and the use of `coercive' loan recovery methods.

We place consumers' struggles with intertemporal self-control issues at the
center of the analysis but argue that borrowers are often more sophisticated
in their understanding of their own time-inconsistency than is often assumed.
From this perspective, `predatory lending' is not primarily about tricking
naive borrowers into paying more than they signed up for with hidden penalties
or misleading interest rates quotes, but about offering excessive flexibility
and refinancing of financial contracts in ways that limit or undermine the
commitments to long term consumption and debt management paths that borrowers
themselves may be attempting to put in place. \ A sophisticated hyperbolic
discounter understands that his `future selves' will attempt to take out new
loans on top of old ones, or renegotiate the terms of existing loans to
further defer debt repayment. That such borrowers should be and are willing to
pay for commitment has been demonstrated in several theoretical and empirical
papers.\footnote{%DIF < 
A `sophisticated' hyperbolic discounter is one who is fully
aware of her time-inconsistency. See, for example, Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin
(2006), Carrillo and Dewatripont (2008), Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson (2010),
Fischer and Ghatak (2010), Basu (2011), and Basu (2012).} By entering into a
loan contract that commits them to a specific time-path of repayments, the
consumer atempts to ensure that future selves will not skew consumption
patterns to privilege instant gratification in the following periods. Viewed
this light, fees and punishments for failing to adhere to a repayment schedule
are not inherently undesirable to the consumer--for sophisticated hyperbolic
discounters, threats of punishment can indeed serve as useful commitment devices.

Nevertheless, the fact that consumers value commitment does not automatically
imply that firms will provide it in equilibrium. In fact, there remains an
open question about whether markets can be relied upon to supply commitment.
The key consideration is the following: if a hyperbolic discounter is willing
to pay to commit her future selves, her future selves are willing to pay to
undo this commitment. Here, a lender that promises to be rigid and is then
flexible could be seen as hurting, rather than helping, the
consumer.\footnote{%DIF < 
Some recent papers demonstrate how commitment can be undone
in related settings. Gottlieb (2008) shows how competition leads to
inefficient outcomes in immediate rewards goods. Heidhues \& Koszegi (2010)
study the mistakes of partially naive borrowers in competitive credit markets.
Mendez (2013) analyzes predatory lending with naive consumers. We extend our
focus to monopoly, which is a particularly relevant market structure for
informal banking in developing economies, and study how the firm's governance
interacts with the renegotiation problem.}

Perspicacious readers will recognize that the idea that firm ownership might
be strategically chosen to solve or ameliorate `contract failure' problems
dates back at least to Arrow (1963)\ and one that has been articulated most
clearly in the work of Henry Hansmann (1980, 1996). \ Hansmann argued that in
markets where the quality of a product or service might be difficult to verify
clients may rationally fear that investor-led firms may be tempted to
opportunistically skimp on the quality of a promised product or service or
reveal a hidden fee, and this can greatly reduce or even eliminate
contracting. \ In such circumstances becoming a `commercial non-profit' may be
a costly but necesary way to commit the firm not act opportunistically, hence
enabling trade. \ Hansmann gives as a primary historical example the
development of consumer saving, lending and insurance products in the United
States and Europe. \ Life insurance in the United States for example has until
quite recently always been dominated by mutuals. \ Rate payers could not trust
investor-led firms to not act opportunistically for example, by increasing
premiums or by skimping or reneging on death benefit payouts. \ Mutuals on the
other hand had little incentive to cheat clients to increase shareholder
dividends as the clients themselves are the only shareholders. Mutuals
therefore enjoyed a distinct competitive advantage until sufficient state
regulatory capacity developed.

In the present analysis we begin by following Hansmann in defining non-profits
by the legal restrictions faced by them, setting aside other ways (such as
motivation) in which they might be different from for-profit
firms.\footnote{%DIF < 
Hence we abstract away from other considerations for
nonprofits, as in Besley \& Ghatak (2005) and McIntosh \& Wydick (2005).
Nonetheless our modeling framework can be adapted to include these
considerations and is the focus of related work.} In this view "[a] nonprofit
organization is, in essence, an organization that is barred from distributing
its net earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such as
members, officers, directors, or trustees. By `net earnings' I mean here pure
profits--that is, earnings in excess of the amount needed to pay for services
rendered to the organization.\textquotedblright\ Glaeser and Shleifer (2000)
and others have formalized Hansmann's central argument to show that when a
firm cannot commit to maintaining high quality, it might choose to operate as
a commercial nonprofit rather than as an investor-led for-profit in order to
credibly signal that it has weaker incentives to cheat the consumer on aspects
of unobserved product quality. As Hansmann describes it, firm ownership form
adapts endogenously as a `crude form of consumer protection' in unregulated
emerging markets where asymmetric information problems are rife. Bubb and
Kaufman (2011) modify this model so that the non-contractible quality issue is
on hidden penalties, which are incurred with certainty by some borrowers.
\ All of these models are built rely on some form of asymmetric information or
contract verification problem.

An important contribution of our paper is to argue that a theory of ownership
form can be built on behavioral microfoundations even in environments with no
asymmetric information and with sophisticated forward-looking agents. \ We
believe this is an important element for understanding the development of
consumer finance in developed countries historically as well as the current
shape of microfinance today where non-profit and `hybrid' forms still dominate
the sector in most developing countries (Cull and Morduch, 2009; Conning and
Morduch, 2011). \ `Hybrid' ownership forms include the many microfinance firms
that though technically incorporated as for-profit financial service providers
are in fact dominated by boards where, by design, social investors\ and/or
client representatives exert substantial governance control. \ Hybrid forms
such as these would appear to confer many of the benefits of non-profit status
(specifically, credible commitment to consumer protection) with fewer of the
costs (in particular, unlike a pure non-profit they can and do issue stock to
outside investors although usually in a manner that does not lead to challenge
control).\footnote{%DIF < 
She goes on to argue that but for bad regulatory law
design, Indian MFIs might have avoided their problems and followed the model
of leading microfinance organizations in other countries like Mibanco and
Bancosol (Bolivia) which "were commercialized with a mix of owners including
the original non-governmental organization (NGO), international social
investors (including development banks), and some local shareholders. The NGOs
kept the focus on the mission, while the international social investors
contributed a commercial orientation, also tempered by social mission. In
Indian microfinance, NGOs are prohibited from becoming shareholders... [and
while clients may be given] a monetary stake in the company .. voting rights
[remain with] the founder/managers. At the same time, foreign investment rules
have made it hard for international social investors to participate in
ownership and governance. The results: founder domination, a pattern that
affects each of the big three MFIs in Andhra Pradesh and leads to a lack of
checks on decisions by managers..." \ Given that and "the entrance of pure
commercial players like Sequoia Capital India" \ it is not surprising to see
an "over-emphasis on fast growth" and a rise in consumer protection
complaints.}

In our earlier mention of the recent crisis of Andhra Pradesh which quoted
Elizabeth Rhyne at length because the rest of her analysis, which ties the
issue of financial intermediary ownership form and their lending pracices,
fits nicely into the framework of our model. \ In her view Indian MFIs might
have avoided their problems and followed the model of leading microfinance
organizations in other countries like Mibanco and Bancosol (Bolivia) which
\textquotedblleft were commercialized with a mix of owners including the
original non-governmental organization (NGO), international social investors
(including development banks), and some local shareholders. The NGOs kept the
focus on the mission, while the international social investors contributed a
commercial orientation, also tempered by social mission.\textquotedblright%DIF > 
\ These are the types of hybrid ownership forms that we shall argue provide
the types of surplus building consumer protection that earlier theory argued
would be supplied primarily by non-profit forms. \ According to Rhyne,Indian
regulatory frameworks and policy decisions made it difficult for effective
hybrid ownership/governance structures to emerge
organically:\ \textquotedblleft In Indian microfinance, NGOs are prohibited
from becoming shareholders... [and while clients may be given] a monetary
stake in the company .. voting rights [remain with] the founder/managers. At
the same time, foreign investment rules have made it hard for international
social investors to participate in ownership and governance. The results:
founder domination, a pattern that affects each of the big three MFIs in
Andhra Pradesh and leads to a lack of checks on decisions by
managers...\textquotedblright\ \ With a flood of easy debt funding and
\textquotedblleft the entrance of pure commercial players like Sequoia Capital
India\textquotedblright\ the \textquotedblleft over-emphasis on fast
growth\textquotedblright\ and rising borower indebtedness and consumer
protection complaints becomes easier to explain.

As we explain below, non-profit or hybrid status firms can serve a useful
purpose even in the absence of contract failure -- the non-profit status
allows them to credibly promise to not renegotiate the terms of a commitment
contract. While the lessons in our paper apply to a wide range of contracts,
our focus is on lending. This modeling approach has the advantage of
generating a number of potentially interesting insights about the shapes of
equilibrium lending contracts.

a consumer protection problem?

\item How does market structure affect bank's choice?
\end{itemize}

\item Standard concerns in consumer protection: hidden fees, bank's moral hazard.

\item We focus on a relatively under-studied problem: the provision of
commitment to time-inconsistent agents.

\item What kind of ownership and market structure helps banks offer credible commitment?

\item Motivating stories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mortgage crisis

\item Microfinance: MFI explosion, apparent over-indebtedness, switch to
for-profit status
\end{itemize}

\item Two-part motivation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For a time-inconsistent borrower, what matters in a loan contract?
Broader notion of consumer protection to include a dynamic commitment problem.
How does a bank commit to not renegotiate the terms of the contract?

\item How does the ability to commit vary based on governance and degree of competition?
\end{enumerate}

\item Key ingredient: Time-inconsistent individual's commitment motives are at
odds with same individual's future motives to undo commitment. For a consumer
to pay for commitment, firm must credibly commit to not undo it.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Commitment device}: contract that alters future action sets or
payoffs associated with future actions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Make savings illiquid (fixed deposits)

\item Carrillo \& Dewatripont (EJ, 2008) -- promises that are costly to break,
asymmetric information

\item Fischer \& Ghatak (2010) - frequent repayment raises maximum
incentive-compatible loan size

\item Threaten punishment for non-repayment of debt
(microfinance--Banerjee--consumption transformation; Roscas--Basu, AEJ:Micro, 2011)
\end{itemize}

\item Growing literature that argues that time-inconsistency and commitment
matter, particularly in banking.

\item We will study this through the lens of loan contracts. Repayment embeds commitment.

\item Common focus of consumer protection/exploitation: (a) fees \&
punishments/naivete (Armstrong \& Vickers, JEL, 2012; Gabaix \& Laibson, QJE,
2006); (b) bank's moral hazard (Dewatripont \& Tirole, 1994; Oak \& Swamy)

\item But: sometimes consumers want punishments. Inability of bank to provide
\textit{credible} punishments should also fall under this umbrella. The
problem survives in the absence of naivete and asymmetric information.

\item The self being committed is willing to pay to rewrite the commitment
contract. Under what conditions would a bank renegotiate? We take seriously
the bank's ex-post considerations.

\subsection{Main Arguments}

In our model, there is no asymmetric information, so there is no uncertainty
of outcome or concern about deception via hidden actions or hidden information
in a contract. Instead, there is a renegotiation problem between fully
informed and optimizing agents. The issue is that after a loan contract is
signed and in effect, a present-biased borrower would, in a later period,
become interested in discarding the contract his period zero self had agreed
to and replace it with a new one that increases present consumption and pushes
repayment further into the future. Since at his later date the client will be
willing to pay to undo her earlier commitment, the bank (or perhaps one of is
competitors)\ might opportunisically pander to its clients impulses and
rewrite the existing contract to raise its profits. A sophisticated
consumeranticipate this potential renegotiation in the initial period. In the
absence of an outside commitment technology the sophisticated bank and the
bank will search for second-best alternatives in renegotiation-proof loan
contracts, but this implies a reduction in the feasible contract space and
therefore in the total surplus or gains to trade that can be extracted. \ 

The bank's inability to commit to not panderint to (i.e. not wanting to profit
from) the client's later selves' temptation to recontract can therefore be
costly to the bank and this may lead it to explore commercial non-profit
status as a mechanism to more credibly commit to not opportunistically
exploiting the weaknesses of its time-inconsistent clients in that way. \ By
operating as a non-profit\ (or more broadly as a `hybrid' bank), the bank
agrees to face legal and/or governance restrictions on how any profits
generated from any such opportunistic renegotiation can be distributed and enjoyed

can more credibly convince the sophisticated consumer that it will be less
likely to renegotiate the contract in the future since the bank's managers and
outside investors now

. \ This allows the bank offer the consumer an initial contract that maintains
the restrictions on future consumption patterns that the consumer demands,
raising the contracting surplus and therefore how much can be ultimately
extracted by the bank's stakeholders. \ 

This argument is very similar in spirit to Henry Hansmann's (XXXX) explanation
for the existence of commercial non-profit firms. \ Note however that his
argument and later formalizations are built on the idea of consumers rational
fear that firms would try to deceive or otherwise opportunistically exploit
the environment of asymmetric information and/or costly enforcement. \ As
Hansmann himself `crude consumer protection'

A firm's decision about whether to adopt non-profit status rests on a
trade-off. As a non-profit, the firm has an opportunity to extract greater
surplus from the consumer (by providing commitment), but now faces
restrictions on the ability of managers and shareholders to enjoy this
surplus. This trade-off is sensitive to market structure. In the case of
monopoly, the bank will adopt nonprofit status if the following is true:
non-profit restrictions should be sufficiently severe that the bank is able to
extract more surplus from the consumer, but should not be so severe that it is
unable to enjoy the surplus.

Under competition, a lender's ability to provide effective commitment through
non-profit status depends on the exclusivity of contracts. When long-term
contracts can be made exclusive, the trade-off disappears and all active firms
function as non-profits. This is because of the zero-profit condition--since
firms do not make profits anyway, there is nothing to lose from switching to
non-profit status. On the other hand, there are profits to be gained--if all
other firms are for-profit, a firm could make positive profits by offering
superior commitment as a non-profit (this is valuable even if its enjoyment of
these profits is limited).

When contracts are not exclusive, commitment generated through non-profit
status becomes impossible to achieve. Since non-profit firms would make zero
profits anyway, each firm has an incentive to switch to for-profit status so
it can take advantage of the opportunity to re-finance \textit{other} banks'
loans. As a result, for-profit firms must be active in equilibrium, and their
presence will eliminate the possibility of non-profit commitment.

This can partly explain a key difference between traditional non-profit
microfinance, which is rigid, and say commercial credit card lending which
offers refinancing flexibility (credit card punishments gain salience because
they are\textit{\ less} strict, not more).

In addition, our model provides a partial (though obviously incomplete)
explanation of trends in global microfinance: the proliferation of lenders
erodes the monopoly advantages (through commitment) gained by non-profit
status, which results in a competitive equilibrium where firms switch to
for-profits and commitment properties of contracts are weakened, resulting in
an apparent over-indebtedness.

The problem of consumer protection in banking has been primarily analyzed
through two channels: naive or uneducated consumers and their failure to
correctly anticipate fees and punishments (Armstrong \& Vickers, JEL, 2012;
Gabaix \& Laibson, QJE, 2006), and bank's moral hazard (Dewatripont \& Tirole,
1994). We argue that, given the growing evidence of time-inconsistent
preferences, a bank's ability to provide credible commitment should also fall
under this umbrella. Through this lens, the model can shed some light on
ongoing debates and stylized facts in both formal and informal credit markets.

bullet points from slides:

\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on the following problem of consumer protection -- consumers want
commitment -- firms want to provide commitment, but are constrained by
governance and market structure. Our question: how?

\item Map out equilibrium loan contracts under monopoly and competition (quite different).

\item Formalize the renegotiation problem.

\item We show how, when there are strategically behaving time-inconsistent
agents and profit-minded lenders, lenders might choose nonprofit status even
if there is no incomplete contracts problem.

\item Here, there is a renegotiation problem instead, and nonprofit lenders
might be able to credibly signal that they will not renegotiate (even if both
both the borrower and lender would like to) when for-profit lenders cannot.
(But: tradeoff)

\item Ability of firms to commit through nonprofit status depends on
exclusivity of contracts and degree of competition (perfect competition can be
good or bad, depending on exclusivity.)

There are three periods, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t\in \left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t\in\left\{  0,1,2\right\}  $}\DIFaddend . In any period $t$,

\section{Monopolist Bank}

In this section, we analyze the renegotiation problem when a sophisticated
present-biased consumer faces a monopolist lender. We first derive properties
of the benchmark equilibrium `full-commitment contract' in the absence of any
renegotiation possibilities. We then describe how the contract would change
when the consumer understands and anticipates the possibility of contract
renegotiation between his later-period self and the bank. Finally, we describe
conditions under which a lender might strategically choose to operate as a
commercial non-profit.

\subsection{Full-Commitment Contract}


The monopolist who can offer a full-commitment contract solves the following
problem:
\begin{align*}
&  \max_{C_{0}}\pi_{0}\left(  C_{0};Y\right) \\
\text{s.t. (PC) }  &  U_{0}\left(  C_{0}\right)  \geq U_{0}\left(  C_{0}%
^{a}(Y)\right)
\end{align*}
Let the monopolist's full-commitment contract be denoted $C^{mf}$. At an optimum:
\begin{align}
  u^{\prime}\left(  c_{0}^{mf}\right)  =\beta\ u^{\prime}\left(  c_{1}
^{mf}\right)  =\beta\ u^{\prime}\left(  c_{2}^{mf}\right) \label{foc-monop}\\
  U_{0}\left(  C_{0}^{mf}\right)  =U_{0}\left(  C_{0}^{a}(Y)\right)
\label{BPC-monop}
\end{align}

Condition \ref{foc-monop} is the standard first-order necessary conditions
that marginal utilities of consumption be equalized across periods which, for our simplifying assumptions, imply that  $c_{1}^{mf}=c_{2}^{mf}=}\overline{c}\DIFadd{^{mf}$. Condition \ref{BPC-monop} is the consumer participation constraint that they
be no worse off by accepting the contract than under autarky. \ For the
CRRA\ case the FOC  imply $}\overline{c}\DIFadd{^{mf}=\beta^{\frac
{1}{\rho}}c_{0}^{mf}$ which, along with the participation constraint, allow for closed form solutions (see appendix). See Figure 1.

The terms of the optimal contract, and hence also the level of bank profits, will  depend on the consumer's starting income stream \(Y_{0}\).   To see this, consider the set of possible initial income streams of constant present value   $\sum_{t=0}^{2}\frac{y_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}=}\bar{y}\DIFadd{$. [DISCUSS 3D?]

\subsection{The Risk of Renegotiation}


Bank  profits can be thought of as deriving in part from  satisfying the customer's `demand for commitment.' That is to say, the bank can charge for helping customers  to stick to preferred saving accumulation \textit{cum} loan repayment plans to deliver balanced consumption across periods 1 and  2 if it can credibly promise to not pander to the customers' later self's demands to raid savings and/or take out new loans that would disrupt those plans.

Figure 2 which is  drawn in $c_{1} -c_{2}$ space  illustrates why the demand for commitment arises, how a monopolist could profit by reneging on such a commitment \textit{ex-post} and therefore why a monopolist might take costly actions to try to make such commitments  more credible \textit{ex-ante}. Point $F$ is the balanced consumption  (\overline{c}^{mf},\overline{c}^{mf} )$ component of the monopolist's optimal contract}\DIFaddendFL . \DIFdelbeginFL %DIFDELCMD < \end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{renegFig} illustrates the type of renegotiated contract that would be offered in the very special case of a  customer who agreed to a full commitment contract $ C_{1}^{mf}$ in period 0 -- having sincerely believed the bank's promise to not offer to renegotiate in period 1 --   was then genuinely and unexpectedly surprised to find the bank offering a renegotiation in period 1. Although it would break a promise to the consumer's period 0 self, the contract will be  designed to appeal to the customer's period 1. This type of renegotiation/promise-breaking will be profitable for the bank to offer  as long as $\pi_{1}}\left(  \DIFadd{C_{1}^{r}}\left(  \DIFadd{C_{1}^{mf}}\right)  \DIFadd{;C_{1}^{mf}}\right)  \DIFadd{\geq\kappa$, where $\kappa$ are the non-monetary renegotiation costs to the bank. As depicted in Figure \ref{renegFig}, the bank will find it profitable to renegotiate from the   continuation of the full commitment  contract depicted by point $F$ to the new contract depicted by $B$ so long as profits gains (equal to the present value difference  between $ C_{1}^{mf}$ and $C_{1}^{r}$) which can be measured as  distance $NQ$ on the diagram is greater than $\kappa$.
 Although the new contract appeals to the period 1 self,  the broken promise  `exploits' the consumer's period 0 self by pushing their welfare below the autarky reservation utility that they thought had been promised by the $C_{1}^{mf}$ contract.  

\subsection{Renegotiation-Proof Contract}

A sophisticated consumer will, of course, rationally anticipate the bank's temptation to break its commitment promises and for this reason would never   agree to accept contract \(F\)  or any other contract that could make him worse off following  a period-1 renegotiation. Since the bank will want to avoid renegotiation costs $\kappa$ the only contracts that will be offered that satisfy this criterion in period 0 must be renegotiation-proof contracts:\  contracts that the bank will not find profitable to renegotiate.  }   



The bank must therefore offer a contract that satisfies
period 0's participation constraint and now also meets an additional renegotiation-proofness constraint. The resulting
contract must limit period 1 self's (and hence also the bank's) potential
gains from renegotiation. It does this by increasing $c_{1}$\ by just enough
relative to $c_{2}$\ as to lower what period 1 self is willing to pay for a
renegotiation to fall  just below the bank's cost $\kappa$, as to keep
renegotiation credibly unprofitable to the bank. \ This must lower bank profits relative to the costless full-commitment case because
the monopolist  must now compensate the consumer for a contract that delivers less
consumption smoothing across period 1 and 2 than under full commitment.

    

The now solves a maximization
problem with two constraints. 


\begin{align*}
&  \max_{C_{0}}\pi_{0}\left(  C_{0};C_{0}^{a}\right) \\
\text{s.t. (PC) }  &  U_{0}\left(  C_{0}\right)  \geq U_{0}\left(  C_{0}%
^{a}\right) \\
\text{(RP) }  &  \pi_{1}\left(  C_{1}^{r}\left(  C_{1}\right)  ;C_{1}\right)
\leq\kappa
\end{align*}


The first restriction is the same participation constraint as before. The
second is a restriction placed by the fact that marginal utilities in periods
1 and 2 cannot be too far apart from period 1's perspective. The new monopolist renegotiation-proof contract $C_{0}^{mp}$ will keep consumption sufficiently
imbalanced (in period 1's favor) so that period 0's beliefs about the
potential gains to period 1 from renegotiating the contract are just smaller
than the costs the bank incurs from renegotiating. 

A slight re-interpretation of Figure  \ref{renegFig}
illustrates the properties of a renegotiation-proof contract in the special case of a monopolist with zero renegotiation cost ($\kappa=0$). In this special case the only contract that satisfies the period 0 self's participation constraint (interpreted here as indifference curve $FR$ where \(F\text{ is no longer the full-commitment contract }\)since period 0 consumption )

must lie along the first-order condition line $c_{2} =\beta ^}{\DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 1\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and 2,

legitimate renegotiation (a voluntary agreement to tear up the old contract)

\subsection{Monopolist as Non-Profit}

Suppose a firm has the possibility of operating as a nonprofit. Speaking in
strictly legal terms the surpluses of a non-profit firm cannot be distributed
as profits. It is however customary and more realistic to model this
restriction more loosely, by assuming that a non-profit can distribute only a
portion $f}\left(  \DIFadd{\pi}\right)  \DIFadd{$ of profits or surplus $\pi$ to its owners or
insiders, where $f}\left(  \DIFaddend 0\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but

Firms can undercut each other in period 1. To analyze the case with
sophisticated hyperbolic discounters, we first ask whether the renegotiation
cost, $\kappa $, applies when a firm undercuts \textit{another} firm's
contract. Suppose not. Then, we can see right away that it's impossible to sustain nonprofits. If there were nonprofits in equilibrium, any one firm
could make positive profits by switching to for-profit status and undoing a
rival bank's contract in period 1. Alternatively,assume that $c$ applies in
the same way to undercutting as it does to renegotiation. Consider
sophisticated hyperbolics. As each firm's market share goes down,it is more
incentivized to be for-profit since the advantages of undercutting the other
firm's contracts outweigh the benefits of promising one's own clients it
will not renegotiate. As a result, equilibrium contracts will be determined
by for-profit firms, and consumers will be offered lower commitment than
from non-profit firms alone.

he is willing to accept a contract that is more profitable for the bank

The firm will choose nonprofit status if the best renegotiation-proof contract

despite lower enjoyment of profits, the firm is better off.

The nonprofit's contract:%

It is instructive to discuss when a firm will encounter conditions conducive
to adopting non-profit status. Administrative costs ($\kappa$) should not be
so high that even for-profits wouldn't renegotiate. The consumer should be
sufficiently hyperbolic ($\beta$ should be low enough) that renegotiation is a
tempting possibility. On the other hand, the consumer should not be so
hyperbolic that even a nonprofit would like to renegotiate.

The difference between effective profits as a non-profit and actual profits as
a for-profit can be written as the following:
\[
n\left[  \pi_{0}\left(  c_{o}^{non},c_{1}^{non},c_{2}^{non}\right)  -\pi
_{0}\left(  c_{0}^{rp},c_{1}^{rp},c_{2}^{rp}\right)  \right]  -\left(
1-n\right)  \left[  \pi_{0}\left(  c_{0}^{rp},c_{1}^{rp},c_{2}^{rp}\right)
\right]
\]
The first term represents the gain from higher raw profits and the second term
represents the loss from discounting the original, for-profit, firm's profits.
In this case, the first term dominates if the potential gain in raw profits is
high, or if the for-profit firm's contract yielded low profits in the first place.

And finally, the nonprofit discount function $f$ should be severe enough to
deter a nonprofit from renegotiating, but not so severe that it deters a firm
from becoming a nonprofit. We are agnostic about the specific functional form
of $f$. However, we can consider two possible cases. First, suppose $f$ is
strictly concave--only mildly restrictive at low levels of profits and
increasingly restrictive as profits grow. Such functions serve as a plausible
description of the legal restrictions faced by non-profits. In such a case, we
can clearly see how non-profit status could be attractive to the firm: the
legal restrictions leave the enjoyment of profits from the contract relatively
unaffected while significantly loosening the no-renegotiation constraint
(since renegotiation would raise profits further, and since $f$ is concave,
these additional profits would count for little).

\subsubsection{Linear Restriction on Nonprofits}

To derive explicit conditions under which a firm will choose to operate as a
nonprofit, let's consider a formulation similar to Glaeser and Shleifer
(2001). Suppose $f}\left(  \DIFadd{\pi_{0}}\right)  \DIFadd{=\alpha\pi_{0}$, where $}\DIFaddend 0\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, so is
willing to accept a less advantageous loan; (b)in period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{<\alpha<}\DIFaddend 1\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, if the contract
was written to satisfy $g\left( \tilde{\beta};m_{1},m_{2}\right) =c$ (which
would be the case if $c$ was sufficiently small), the bank will renegotiate
the contract. The relationship between sophistication and outcome is not
continuous: under certain conditions, the moment there is the slightest
naivete, we observe renegotiation, resulting in a discrete drop in welfare.

\DIFdel{Suppose that the threat of signing a contract with the same bank in period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$.
Glaeser and Shleifer (2001) adopt this approach suggesting that it captures
the idea that though legally barred from paying themselves cash profits, the
principals of a non-profit can capture profits but only imperfectly via the
consumption of perquisites\ (or `dividends in kind') valued as $\alpha\pi.$ We
will interpret $\alpha$ as an index of `non-profitness.' \ A lower $\alpha$

its ownership/governance structure places the welfare of its clients ahead of

\DIFdel{But this also changes the bank's considerations about whether to turn
nonprofit. If it were to not offer a contract today, it could offer one the
next period and make profits. So, in period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$
comes from the relaxation of the no-renegotiation constraint which by
assumption occurs whenever $\kappa(\alpha)>}\overline{\kappa}\DIFadd{$ when. Because
the non-profit can more credibly commit to not renegotiate contracts that
offer greater consumption smoothing in periods 1 and 2, period 0 becomes more
willing to transfer surplus to the firm. \ Let the resulting contract offered
by a non-profit of type $\alpha$ be denoted $}\left(  \DIFadd{c_{o}^{\alpha}%DIF > 
,c_{1}^{\alpha},c_{2}^{\alpha}}\right)  \DIFadd{$ and the firm's realized net profits
or benefits $\Pi(\alpha)=$ $\alpha\cdot\pi_{0}}\left(  \DIFadd{c_{o}^{\alpha}%DIF > 
,c_{1}^{\alpha},c_{2}^{\alpha}}\right)  \DIFadd{.$

Whether a firm would choose to convert to non-profit status of type $\alpha$
will depend on whether the residual surplus (perquisites)\ that its principals
can capture from greater commitment possibilities match or exceed what it
could earn offering renegotiation proof contracts as a pure for-profit.

\begin{proposition}
A bank will operate as a nonprofit if the consumer's income spread, $\sigma$,
is sufficiently close to $\sigma^{mp-l}$ or $\sigma^{mp-s}$.
\end{proposition}

At $\sigma=\sigma^{mp-l}$ or $\sigma=\sigma^{mp-s}}\,\DIFadd{$, the for-profit bank
makes zero profits. But the nonprofit makes positive profits. So the bank will
operate as a nonprofit. Using continuity of profits in $y_{0}$, we know that
the bank will choose to operate as a nonprofit for a window around both
$}\bar{y}\DIFadd{_{0}^{\prime}$ and $}\bar{y}\DIFadd{_{0}^{\prime\prime}$.

[CRRA simulations.]

In such a case, the consumer has been left no worse off than under a
for-profit firm, and the firm is made better off. By solving the commitment
problem, it is able to extract greater surplus from the consumer.

\section{Competition [incorporate new notation; savings]}

Consider a competitive banking environment where banks must compete to offer
lending contracts to the consumer. In this setting, all surplus is returned to
the consumer and equilibrium contracts will satisfy a zero-profit condition
for the banks. As under monopoly, we first describe equilibrium contracts when
renegotiation is impossible. We then analyze firms' decisions to operate as
nonprofits, which will depend on the exclusivity of contracts.




 
\subsubsection{MOVED FROM ABOVE Section on borrowing or saving (change/move)}


\begin{proposition}
There is some cut-off level of income spread, $\sigma^{mf}\in}\left(  \DIFadd{0,}\bar
{\DIFadd{y}}\right)  \DIFadd{$ that satisfies the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\sigma<\sigma^{mf}$, a loan contract is offered. If $\sigma
>\sigma^{mf}$, a savings contract is offered. If $\sigma=\sigma^{mf}$, no
contract is offered.

\item Profits are continuous in $\sigma$, and rising in the distance from
$\sigma^{mf}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

[Prove proposition, discuss comparative statics over $\sigma$ (how commitment
problems arise in both savings and loan), relate to movement in Figure 1].
\subsubsection{Renegotiation and $\beta $ (moved)} 




\subsection{Benchmark Contract}

Consider a competitive banking environment with zero profits in equilibrium.
We assume that contracts are exclusive (a consumer can interact with only one
bank for the life of a loan) and that banks can commit to not renegotiate.
Firms will return all surplus to the consumer, and the equilibrium contract is
given by:%
\begin{align*}
&  \max_{c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}}U_{t}\left(  c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}\right) \\
&  \text{s}\text{.t}\text{.}\text{ }\pi_{0}\left(  c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}\right)
\geq0
\end{align*}


The first-order conditions are same as under monopoly. Combined with the
zero-profit constraint, yield the equilibrium contract:%
\[
\hat{c}_{0},\hat{c}_{1},\hat{c}_{2}%
\]


We continue to have $}\hat{c}\DIFadd{_{1}=}\hat{c}\DIFadd{_{2}\equiv}\hat{c}\DIFadd{_{f}$.

This can be compared to the monopolist's contract along two dimensions.
Observe the following comparison between the monopolist's maximization problem
and the competitive equilibrium.%

%EndExpansion


The competitive contract must satisfy the zero-profit constraint and the
first-order conditions, while the monopolist's contract must satisfy the
borrower's participation constraint and the first-order condition. Since the
curve associated with the first-order condition is downward sloping, the
competitive contract has a higher loan size and smaller repayment. The arrow
in Figure 5 indicates the direction in which the first-order condition moves
as $\beta$ drops. This will result in a new contract at a higher point of
intersection with the zero-profit constraint, which implies a larger loan size
and higher repayment. This gives us the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
(a)Relative to the profit-maximizing monopolist, the competitive equilibrium
contract will have a larger loan size and smaller repayment. (b) As $\beta$
drops, loan size and repayments will rise.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Firms as Non-Profit}

\subsubsection{Exclusive Contracts}

Now we consider competitive markets where contracts are exclusive, but firms
cannot commit to not renegotiate. For for-profit firms, the problem becomes:%

\begin{align*}
&  \max_{l,m_{1},m_{2}}u\left(  l\right)  +\beta\delta u\left(  y-m_{1}%
\right)  +\beta\delta^{2}u\left(  y-m_{2}\right) \\
&  \text{s}\text{.t}\text{.}\text{ }\pi\left(  l,m_{1},m_{2}\right)  \geq0\\
&  g\left(  \beta;m_{1},m_{2}\right)  \leq c
\end{align*}


Let the resulting contract be denoted $}\left(  \tilde{c}\DIFadd{_{0},}\tilde{c}%DIF > 
\DIFadd{_{1},}\tilde{c}\DIFadd{_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{$.

If the no-renegotiation constraint is binding, consumer welfare must be lower
than when the firms can commit to not renegotiate. Now, firms face a potential
incentive to switch to non-profit status. By loosening the second constraint,
one firm deviating into nonprofit status can make positive profits. So, if the
borrowers are sophisticated hyperbolics, in equilibrium all firms become
nonprofit even if the borrowers are \textit{nearly} exponential.

\begin{proposition}
In a competitive banking market with exclusive contracts, if consumers are
sophisticated hyperbolic discounters and $\kappa$ is small enough, all active
firms will be nonprofits.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\lbrack switch notation in proof] Assume $\kappa$ is small enought that the
no-renegotiation constraint binds for the for-profit renegotiation-proof
contract, $}\left(  \tilde{l}\DIFadd{,}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{1},}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{$. Suppose
all firms are for-profit. There is some $\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\varepsilon
_{2}$ satisfying $}\DIFaddend 0\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it offers a contract as long
as the profits are higher than if it simply offered a period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{<\varepsilon_{2}<\varepsilon_{1}$ such that $u}\left(
\tilde{l}\right)  \DIFadd{+\beta\delta u}\left(  \tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{1}-\varepsilon_{1}}\right)
\DIFadd{+\beta\delta u}\left(  \tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{=$ $u}\left(
\tilde{l}\right)  \DIFadd{+\beta\delta u}\left(  \tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{1}}\right)  \DIFadd{+\beta\delta
u}\left(  \tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{$ and $f}\left(  \DIFadd{\pi}\left(  \tilde{l}\DIFadd{,}\tilde
{\DIFadd{m}}\DIFadd{_{1}-\varepsilon_{1},}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}-\varepsilon_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{+g}\left(
\DIFadd{\beta;}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{1}-\varepsilon_{1},}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}}\right)
\right)  \DIFadd{-f}\left(  \DIFadd{\pi}\left(  \tilde{l}\DIFadd{,}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{1},}\tilde{m}\DIFadd{_{2}}\right)
\right)  \DIFadd{\leq c$. So, any firm can make positive profits by operating as a
non-profit. Therefore, in equilibrium, consumers will borrow only from
non-profit firms.
\end{proof}

In this case, the specific form of $f}\left(  \DIFadd{\pi}\right)  \DIFadd{$ does not matter
because firms are making zero profits in equilibrium anyway.

\subsubsection{Non-Exclusive Contracts}

In the previous section, we had a setting with competition in period 0 but
monopoly power in period 1. Now, assume period 1 monopoly power disappears.
Firms can undercut each other in period 1. To analyze the case with
sophisticated hyperbolic discounters, we first ask whether the renegotiation
cost, $\kappa$, applies when a firm undercuts \textit{another} firm's
contract. Suppose not. Then, we can see right away that it's impossible to
sustain nonprofits. If there were nonprofits in equilibrium, any one firm
could make positive profits by switching to for-profit status and undoing a
rival bank's contract in period 1. Alternatively, assume that $c$ applies in
the same way to undercutting as it does to renegotiation. Consider
sophisticated hyperbolics. As each firm's market share goes down, it is more
incentivized to be for-profit since the advantages of undercutting the other
firm's contracts outweigh the benefits of promising one's own clients it will
not renegotiate. As a result, equilibrium contracts will be determined by
for-profit firms, and consumers will be offered lower commitment than from
non-profit firms alone.

\begin{proposition}
In a competitive banking market with exclusive contracts, if consumers are
sophisticated hyperbolic discounters, for-profits must exist in equilibrium.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\lbrack switch notation in proof] (a) Suppose the renegotiation cost, $c$,
does not apply when a bank offers a period 1 loan on another bank's contract.
Firms will compete in period $}\DIFaddend 1\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contract.This means that the window where banks turn nonprofit in our model (the
region where the for-profit's profits are near 0)gets smaller.

If all firms are nonprofit, an individual firm has a strict incentive to
switch to for-profit status, and make profits in period 1. Therefore, there
must be for-profits in equilibrium, and equilibrium contracts will be
constrained by their presence.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion and Extensions}

\subsection{Naivete and Private Information}

The problem of potential renegotiation applies to all hyperbolic discounters,
but only the sophisticated fully anticipates it in period 0. The partially
naive consumer underestimates the extent of the renegotiation, and the naif
believes he will not give into the temptation to renegotiate.

For exponential discounters and naifs, the bank is not hurt by an inability to
commit to not renegotiate. In the case of the exponential discounter, this is
because there is never an opportunity to renegotiate in a mutually beneficial
manner. In the case of the naif, he \textit{believes} his future self will not
have a future incentive to renegotiate. If $c$ is sufficiently small, he will
be mistaken in this belief, and the bank will offer renegotiation. So, for a
naive consumer, the bank is making additional profits on two margins: since
there is no perceived renegotiation problem, he is willing to accept a
contract that is more profitable for the bank up-front; subsequently,
renegotiation generates additional profits for the bank.

Finally, consider the partially naive agent with beliefs $}\tilde{\beta}\DIFadd{>\beta
$: she will take insufficient precautions to prevent getting into situations
where the bank will offer to renegotiate. As she gets more naive, her
miscalculation worsens: (a) she gets more optimistic in period 0, so is
willing to accept a less advantageous loan; (b) in period 1, if the contract
was written to satisfy $g}\left(  \tilde{\beta}\DIFadd{;m_{1},m_{2}}\right)  \DIFadd{=c$ (which
would be the case if $c$ was sufficiently small), the bank will renegotiate
the contract. The relationship between sophistication and outcome is not
continuous: under certain conditions, the moment there is the slightest
naivete, we observe renegotiation, resulting in a discrete drop in welfare.

\subsection{Period 1 Contracts}

Suppose that the threat of signing a contract with the same bank in period 1
remains. So, if you don't sign a contract in period 0, you might end up
signing one in period 1 just to tilt consumption.

This changes the participation constraint--it gets looser. This loosening of
the PC does not depend on $y_{0}$. The bank's profits get bigger.

But this also changes the bank's considerations about whether to turn
nonprofit. If it were to not offer a contract today, it could offer one the
next period and make profits. So, in period 0 it offers a contract as long as
the profits are higher than if it simply offered a period 1 contract. This
means that the window where banks turn nonprofit in our model (the region
where the for-profit's profits are near 0) gets smaller.

\subsection{Other Forms of Governance}

In addition it is also reasonable to imagine that a nonprofit firm might face
greater pressure and scrutiny, internal or external, to consider the
consumer's welfare cost of renegotiation. \ The cost of renegotiation becomes
$\kappa(\alpha)$ which we expect to be non-increasing in $\alpha$ falling to
$\kappa(\alpha)=}\overline{\kappa}\DIFadd{$ as $\alpha$ approaches 1. There are two
implications of adopting nonprofit status then: lower enjoyment of profits and
a lower incentive to renegotiate in period 1.

\bigskip

The model presented above formalizes the renegotiation problem in the context
of lending to sophisticated hyperbolic discounters. We show how non-profit
banks can play a key role in alleviating the problem. For a monopolist, if
nonprofit status is sufficiently but not too restrictive, the firm will
operate as nonprofit. As firms begin to compete, nonprofit survival is robust
if contracts are exclusive, but fragile if contracts are non-exclusive. This
suggests that, in banking markets that were once served by monopolists, entry
of additional banks will serve to both erode commitment and encourage the
growth of for-profits.

While the restrictive assumptions of the model serve to illuminate a number of
points, they also suggest some natural extensions. In particular, it would be
instructive to solve for equilibrium under heterogeneous borrowers with
private information, and in richer environments with uncertainty and strategic
default. These will be addressed in future work.

\subsection{Stuff moved from earlier in the text}

[**** FROM\ BANKS section:\ A short note on the other assumptions is in order.
While we explicitly set up our problem as one of borrowing/saving and
re-financing, the analysis and insights apply more broadly to questions about
the role of firm ownership and governance structure choices in any setting
where dynamically inconsistent preferences could lead to a contract
renegotiation problem. We choose to embed this problem in a borrowing
framework for two reasons: first, we believe this model can shed light on some
"real-world" stylized facts related to household debt; and second, we derive
some interesting implications for the specific shapes of equilibrium loan
contracts which would have remained hidden in a more general analysis. ****]

NOTE that non-monotonic in $\beta$


\subsubsection{The Role of $\beta$}

As an interesting relevant aside note that there is no clearly monotonic
relationship between loan size and the consumer's measure of present bias
$\beta$. As $\beta$ drops from 1, two things happen: the consumer becomes
willing to accept a smaller loan for any given repayment (participation
constraint shifts down) but also becomes willing to pay more for larger loans
than before (first-order condition rotates down).

Figure 1 plots a representative equilibrium solution (intersection of the
first-order condition and participation constraint) for $\beta=1$. The arrows
indicate how the constraints would shift as $\beta$ drops, or the consumer
becomes more present-biased. The borrower's participation constraint shifts
down--as the consumer cares less about the future, he is willing to sacrifice
more future consumption for a given loan today. The first-order condition
rotates counterclockwise--for any consumption in the future, the consumer must
receive a greater loan today to equalize discounted marginal utilities as
$\beta$ drops.

Since both constraints shift down relative to the initial equilibrium with
$\beta=1$, $c_{1}^{mf}$ and $c_{2}^{mf}$ must unambiguously fall at a the new
intersection as $\beta$ drops. On the other hand, $}\bar{c}\DIFadd{_{0}$ is not
necessarily monotonic in $\beta$. As $\beta$ drops, the consumer is initially
willing to pay substantially for slight increases in the loan size. As $\beta$
continues to drop, repayment becomes less salient, so the bank can generate
higher profits by lowering the loan size while continuing to raise repayment
amounts. When facing a monopolist, hyperbolic discounters don't "over-borrow"
in the obvious sense.
