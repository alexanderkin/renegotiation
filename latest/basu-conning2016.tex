\begin{abstract}
When do financial intermediaries provide the commitment services to help present-biased consumers stick to long-term savings accumulation and/or debt management plans?  When do they instead opportunistically pander to consumer biases and by how much might financial trade be reduced by consumer fears this could happen?  We study a consumer protection problem that survives even when consumers are sophisticated and fully informed. The consumer would like to commit her future selves to a balanced path of saving accumulation \textit{cum} debt repayment via a commitment contract, but her future selves can be tempted to raid savings or take on new debt.  Investor-owned banks may find it costly to credibly commit to refrain from such opportunistic exploitation, leading to lower ex-ante bank profits and/or consumer welfare and lost trade. In such contexts strategic adjustments to bank ownership and governance forms may lower the cost of credible (or renegotiation-proof) commitment contracts because explicit limitations on profit distribution signal weaker contract renegotiation  incentives.  This leads to a theory of commercial non-profits and endogenous client protection similar to \cite{hansmann_ownership_1996} but on new behavioral micro-foundations. The extent of market competition, the legal environment, and the consumption-smoothing needs of the client base shape the distribution of ownership forms. The helps understand the evolution of ownership and contract forms in consumer banking, microfinance, and mortgage and payday lending and frames debates over proposed consumer protection measures against excessive refinancing and `overindebtedness'  in these sectors.

\section{Introduction}

Hyperbolic discounters -- consumers with present-biased preferences -- are those who struggle to stick to  their long-term asset accumulation or debt management plans and for this reason may benefit from
the `commitment services'  or  designed restrictions that a financial intermediary may build into multi-period financial contracts.   Long-term consumption smoothing goals are more likely to be achieved where customers can enlist financial intermediaries to act as their partners in resisting  later temptations to raid savings and/or   increase debt in ways that could undermine  responsible long-term plans. The properties of \textit{costlessly}-enforced optimal
commitment banking contracts have been examined in several theoretical papers
\citep{laibson_golden_1997} and a number of randomized controlled trials and other empirical studies have   found quite large impacts from introducing new commitment service savings products (see for example \cite{Thaler_Benartzi_2004, ashraf_tying_2006} and the studies mentioned in the survey by \citet{bryan_commitment_2010}). This evidence suggests an unsatisfied real demand for commitment services in many places but also begs the question of why the market was not already providing them.  

The assumption of costless commitment services is hard to sustain. Commitments can be broken and the same person that at first demanded a commitment
contract from a bank may  later want to renegotiate its terms. A bank's ex-post profits can often be increased by pandering to such demands.   For example, a present-biased consumer who takes out a loan that  promises to balance repayments and expected consumption across future periods may
at a later period be unable to resist the bank's tempting offer to refinance of their offer ofan expensive (but at this later date attractive)\  additional consumption   loan that drives up immediate consumption but wrecks earlier laid consumption smoothing plans.    

This type of problem raises obvious consumer protection concerns in the case of naive or partially naive present-biased consumers
as these are consumers who, by definition, do not understand how their own future preferences will evolve to make them vulnerable to such opportunistic exploitation by a bank. In the absence of consumer protection a bank might attempt to lure customers with attractive teaser contracts that it knows can  be later renegotiated for additional gain.  
 
Consumer protection issues also arise in the case of sophisticated present-biased consumers but take the less obvious and  harder to measure form of reduced or lost financial trade. \ Sophisticated consumers anticipate the possibility of opportunistic contract renegotiation and therefore will be cautious to minimize their vulnerability by insisting on renegotiation-proof contracts that must be endogenously enforced. But  imposing  any such additional constraints can only reduce the feasible financial contract space, reducing gains from trade and therefore lowering bank profits and/or consumer welfare or lost trade.
\ The practical result in either case will be equilibria with less than optimal consumption smoothing  due to saving `too little' and/or borrowing `too much' (in the estimation of their earlier period selves) in some periods compared to situations where full-commitment contracts could be costlessly offered.

Concerns about excessive refinancing and `over-indebtedness' have been raised  in the wake of recent financial crises in both the developed and the developing world.    On the eve of the mortgage banking crisis in 2007, over 70 percent of new subprime mortgage loans were refinances
of existing mortgages and approximately 84 percent of these were `cash out' refinances \citep{demyanyk_understanding_2011}.  In the market for payday loans the concern of many economists and regulatory observers is often not so much that fees are high for one-time short-term loans (typical cost is 15\% of the amount borrowed on a 2 week loan) but rather that over 80 percent of payday loans are `rolled over' or renewed rather than paid off, incurring new fees each time resulting in very high  total loan costs and  placing many people into  very difficult debt management situations \citep{DeYoung_2015}.\footnote{Approximately half payday loans are rolled over in sequences lasting 7 or more turns}   

Similar concerns have been raised in microfinance markets in developing countries but in such markets where  government  consumer protection laws are weak to non-existent, the issues
take on an interesting extra dimension.
To state our hypothesis briefly and bluntly:  microfinance markets around the world have been dominated by a mix of mission-driven and commercial non-profits and  `hybrid' firms -- for example for-profit firms  partly or entirely owned and controlled by not-for-profit foundations or governments \citep{conning_microfinance_2011,cull_microfinance_2009}. We argue that this is because, compared to investor-led for-profit firms hybrid and non-profit firms can make more credible commitments to not engage in the type of opportunism described above, because their incentive to do so is muted by the fact that they cannot easily distribute any profits. This is a variation on Henry Hansmann's theory of commercial non-profits but set on new behavioral micro-foundations that we will model explicitly below. In the early stages of new microfinance markets one or more non-profit firms may dominate and successfully provide the commitment services in savings and credit contracts.  However new entry and intensified market competition  diminishes the capturable rents and hence the  strategic advantage of non-profit status  and this can lead to a `commercialization' stage and the conversion of many non-profits to for-profit forms. This will be associated with a rise of of the type of consumer protection issues identified above and  concomitant collapse of borrower and saver discipline. A string of over-indedtedness and repayment crises in places as far flung as Morocco, Bosnia, Nicaragua, and Andra Pradesh in India which previously had successful microfinance markets appear to have followed broadly similar story lines. 
   

 In this paper we view the provision of commitment as an important
element of consumer protection in banking. Our goal is to provide a simple dynamic framework
for analyzing real-world settings where commitment is demanded but
cannot be credibly provided at zero cost. We work with a quite general three-period consumption smoothing model for a sophisticated present-biased consumer with quasi-hyperbolic preferences that allows for saving (repayment) or borrowing (dissaving) in each period. In each contracting scenario the consumer's period Zero-self (henceforth `Zero-self')\ has a bias for present consumption but wants to smooth future consumption across periods one and two.  They correctly 
anticipate that their later period-one `One-self' will have a change of preferences that  will lead them to want to `raid savings' and/or take on new debt to drive up period one consumption at the expense of period two consumption, thereby undoing Zero's early intent to balance consumption across the two periods. In every case the equilibrium contract will be the subgame perfect
Nash equilibrium of a game where Zero-self chooses a contract  first anticipating One-self's reactions, possibly limited by the Bank's exogenously or endogenously enforced commitment to agree to not renegotiate with One-self.   

In the first part of the paper we characterize the contracts associated with three broad scenarios: (1) \textbf{Full-commitment contracts} where we  assume the Zero-self consumer can enter into multi-period contract that binds their One-self to not renegotiate the contract terms under the assumption that this bank commitment can be costlessly enforced; (2) \textbf{No-commitment renegotiation-proof contracts} where the sophisticated consumer chooses contract terms strategically in anticipation of  the fact that her later self will attempt to  refinance the contract and the initial bank (or some new bank) will  pander to that demand as their cost to recontracting $\kappa$ is zero; and  (3)  \textbf{Imperfect-commitment renegotiation-proof contracts} where the Zero-self consumer can enter into a multi-period  contract that helps bind their One-self to  contract terms but where the bank's commitment must be endogenously enforced.  This will be the case when the bank's ex-post gain in profits from breaking their commitment falls short of any direct renegotiation costs $\kappa$. We describe the terms of renegotiation-proof contracts and the distribution of gains to trade between bank and consumer and how these are parameterized by $\kappa.$ At high enough values the bank can credibly commit to not profit from renegotiation and the first-best costless full-commitment contract can be achieved.  The bank would like to credibly signal a high renegotiation cost $\kappa$ but in practice this will be costly.  
In the second part of the paper we explore how a bank's costly strategic changes to its bank ownership and governance structures can be interpreted as a way to credibly commit to not renegotiate but the choice to use this mechanisms is governed by costly tradeoffs that will be shaped by the legal environment and market structure.    

We are able to provide quite complete characterizations of optimal contracting scenarios under the assumption of monopoly or competition in the market for period-zero banking contracts with or  without the assumption of enforceable exclusive contracts in later periods. We can provide exact closed-form solutions for contract terms for  CRRA utility functions for most of these cases including renegotiation-proof contracts when $\kappa=0$.  For the   $\kappa>0 $ cases where closed form solutions cannot be directly obtained we can  nonetheless characterize some important contract properties and solve for contracts numerically. Separately we also characterize the terms of the contract that would be offered to a naive present-biased consumer by a bank that would strategically renegotiate the contract.  


With sophisticated hyperbolic discounters, the bank wishes it could
credibly commit to not renegotiate in the future. Its choice of governance
and ownership structures may help it do so. A nonprofit firm, for
example, faces legal restrictions on its enjoyment of earnings. So,
if the bank operates as a nonprofit, it can demonstrate to the consumer
that it has less to gain from future renegotiation. This improves
its ability to commit to a commitment contract, which allows it to
extract more surplus from the consumer. Whether it chooses to adopt
nonprofit status depends on the extent to which legal restrictions
improve its ability to commit while protecting its ability to enjoy
the additional surplus extracted through commitment. That nonprofit
firms may survive even in the absence of motivated agents or asymmetric
information is, to the best of our knowledge, a novel result.

Our model considers nonprofits more broadly than in the above example,
and analyzes governance choices across consumer types and market settings.
A monopolist bank prefers to operate as a nonprofit if consumers need
relatively small adjustments to their consumption. In competitive
markets, exclusivity plays an important role--if contracts are exclusive,
firms operate as nonprofits; otherwise, for-profits dominate.



Banks, under both monopoly and competition, may explore commercial
nonprofit status as a mechanism to more credibly commit to not opportunistically
exploiting the weaknesses of its sophisticated time-inconsistent clients.
By operating as a nonprofit (or more broadly as a `hybrid' bank),
the bank agrees to face legal or governance restrictions on how any
profits generated from any such opportunistic renegotiation can be
distributed and enjoyed. The bank can now credibly convince the sophisticated
consumer that it will be less likely to renegotiate the contract in
the future. This allows the bank to offer the consumer an initial
contract that maintains the restrictions on future consumption patterns
that the consumer demands, raising the contracting surplus and therefore
how much can be ultimately extracted by the bank's stakeholders.

A firm's decision about whether to adopt nonprofit status rests on
a trade-off. As a non-profit, the firm has an opportunity to extract
greater surplus from the consumer (by providing commitment), but now
faces restrictions on the ability of managers and shareholders to
enjoy this surplus. In the case of monopoly, the bank will adopt nonprofit
status if the following is true: non-profit restrictions should be
sufficiently severe that the bank is able to extract more surplus
from the consumer, but should not be so severe that it is unable to
enjoy the surplus. We show how the details of the trade-off depend
on the governance choices available to the bank and the consumer's
reservation outcomes.

This trade-off is also sensitive to market structure. Under competition,
a lender's ability to provide effective commitment through non-profit
status depends on the exclusivity of contracts. When long-term contracts
can be made exclusive, the trade-off disappears and all active firms
function as non-profits. This is because of the zero-profit condition--since
firms do not make profits anyway, there is nothing to lose from switching
to non-profit status. On the other hand, there are profits to be gained--if
all other firms are for-profit, a firm could make positive profits
by offering superior commitment as a non-profit (this is valuable
even if its enjoyment of these profits is limited).

When contracts are not exclusive, commitment generated through non-profit
status becomes impossible to achieve. Since non-profit firms would
make zero profits anyway, each firm has an incentive to switch to
for-profit status so it can take advantage of the opportunity to re-finance
\textit{other} banks' loans. As a result, for-profit firms must be
active in equilibrium, and their presence will eliminate the possibility
of non-profit commitment.

This can partly explain a key difference between traditional non-profit
microfinance, which is rigid, and say commercial credit card lending
which offers refinancing flexibility (credit card punishments gain
salience because they are\textit{ less} strict, not more). 

The model is indeed stylized and limited to one of many mechanisms,
but we argue that it makes a number of compelling points relevant
to ongoing policy debates and is able to explain some stylized facts.



\subsection{Context and Related Literature}


\subsubsection{Commitment as a form of Consumer Protection}

Problems of consumer protection are typically analyzed through two
channels: naive or uneducated consumers and their failure to correctly
anticipate fees and punishments (see \citet{gabaix_shrouded_2006},
\citet{armstrong_consumer_2012}, and \citet{akerlof_phishing_2015}
for related arguments), and bank's moral hazard (see \citet{dewatripont_prudential_1999}
and \citet{oak_only_2010}). We argue that, given the growing evidence
of time-inconsistent preferences,\footnote{See, for example, \citet{laibson_debt_2003}, \citet{ashraf_tying_2006},
\citet{gugerty_you_2007}, and \citet{tanaka_risk_2010}.} a bank's ability to provide credible commitment should also fall
under this umbrella--sometimes consumers \textit{want} punishments
or fees to limit renegotiation.

In recent years, especially in light of crises in consumer credit
markets, there has been renewed emphasis on consumer protection and
better governance and regulation in banking.\footnote{In the US, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was set up in
2011 under the Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act. In India, the far-reaching Micro Finance Institutions Development
and Regulation Bill of 2012 was designed to increase government oversight
of MFIs in response to the credit crisis in the state of Andhra Pradesh,
and the perception that lax consumer protection and aggressive lending
practices had led to rising over-indebtedness and stress.} One particular outcome of concern has been borrower over-indebtedness,
an issue that has been at the center of recent microfinance repayment
crises in places as far-flung as Morocco, Bosnia, Nicaragua and India,
as well as the 2008 mortgage lending crisis in the United States.
In each of these cases the issue of refinancing or the taking of loans
from multiple lenders emerges. For example, by value, more than two-thirds
of the subprime mortgage loans outstanding in 2008 were made up of
refinanced loans \citep{demyanyk_understanding_2011}.

Journalistic and scholarly analyses of such situations, including
the recent mortgage crisis in the United States, have often framed
the issues as problems of consumer protection, suggesting that many
lenders designed products to purposefully take advantage of borrowers
who have limited financial literacy skills and are naive about their
self-control problems. Informed by such interpretations, new regulations
introduced in the wake of these crises have swung toward restricting
the terms of allowable contracts, for example by setting maximum interest
rates, and the use of coercive loan recovery methods.

We place consumers' struggles with intertemporal self-control issues
at the center of the analysis, but argue that borrowers may be more
sophisticated in their understanding of their own time-inconsistency
than is often assumed. From this perspective, `predatory lending'
is not primarily about tricking naive borrowers into paying more than
they signed up for with hidden penalties or misleading interest rates
quotes, but about offering excessive flexibility and refinancing of
financial contracts in ways that limit or undermine the commitments
to long term consumption and debt management paths that borrowers
themselves may be attempting to put in place.\footnote{\citet{bond_predatory_2009} discuss evidence of predatory lending
in the context of mortgages.}

A sophisticated hyperbolic discounter understands that his `future
selves' will attempt to take out new loans on top of old ones, or
renegotiate the terms of existing loans to further defer debt repayment.
If she is a saver, she will try to withdraw more rapidly in the future
than she would have liked, or will deposit less than ideal. That such
consumers should be and are willing to pay for commitment has been
demonstrated in several theoretical and empirical papers \citep[for examples of commitment, see][]{ashraf_tying_2006,carrillo_promises_2008,
bryan_commitment_2010, fischer_repayment_2010, banerjee_poor_2011,
basu_hyperbolic_2011}. By entering into a contract that
commits them to a specific time-path of repayments or deposits, the
consumer attempts to ensure that future selves will not skew consumption
patterns to privilege instant gratification in the following periods.
Viewed this light, fees and punishments for failing to adhere to a
schedule are not inherently undesirable to the consumer--for sophisticated
hyperbolic discounters, threats of punishment can indeed serve as
useful commitment devices. 

Nevertheless, the fact that consumers value commitment does not automatically
imply that firms will provide it in equilibrium. In fact, there remains
an open question about whether markets can be relied upon to supply
commitment. The key consideration in this paper is the following:
if a hyperbolic discounter is willing to pay to commit her future
selves, her future selves are willing to pay to undo this commitment.
Here, a bank that promises to be rigid and is then flexible could
be seen as hurting, rather than helping, the consumer. We take seriously
the bank's ex-post considerations and derive conditions under which
it would renegotiate.

In this sense, our paper complements some others that demonstrate
how commitment can be undone in related settings. \citet{gottlieb_competition_2008}
shows how competition leads to inefficient outcomes in immediate rewards
goods. \citet{heidhues_exploiting_2010} study the mistakes of partially
naive borrowers in competitive credit markets. \citet{mendez_predatory_2012}
analyzes predatory lending with naive consumers. Our framework is  encompassing, allowing us to study generic banking contracts with saving or borrowing: under both competition and monopoly (the latter being particularly relevant
to informal banking in developing economies), for both sophisticated
an naive consumers, and for multiple governance and ownership structures.


\subsubsection{Commercial Non-profits in finance}

The idea that firm ownership might be strategically chosen to solve
or ameliorate `contract failure' problems dates back at least to \citet{arrow_uncertainty_1963}
and is one that has been articulated most clearly in the work of Henry
Hansmann (1996). Hansmann
argued that in markets where the quality of a product or service might
be difficult to verify, clients may rationally fear that investor-led
firms will be tempted to opportunistically skimp on the quality of
a promised product or service, or reveal a hidden fee, and this can
greatly reduce or even eliminate contracting. In such circumstances
becoming a `commercial non-profit' may be a costly but necessary way
to commit the firm to not act opportunistically, hence enabling trade. 

Hansmann gives as a primary historical example the development of
consumer saving, lending and insurance products in the United States
and Europe. Life insurance in the United States for example has until
quite recently always been dominated by mutuals. Rate payers could
not trust investor-led firms to not act opportunistically by, for
example, increasing premiums or by skimping or reneging on death benefit
payouts. Mutuals on the other hand had little incentive to cheat clients
to increase shareholder dividends as the clients themselves are the
only shareholders. Mutuals therefore enjoyed a distinct competitive
advantage until sufficient state regulatory capacity developed.

In the present analysis we begin by following Hansmann in defining
nonprofits by the legal restrictions faced by them, setting aside
other ways (such as motivation) in which they might be different from
for-profit firms.\footnote{Hence we abstract away from other considerations for nonprofits, as
in \citet{besley_competition_2005}, \citet{mcintosh_competition_2005},
and \citet{guha_micro-finance_2013}. Nonetheless our modeling framework
can be adapted to include these considerations and is the focus of
related work.} In this view \textquotedbl{}{[}a{]} nonprofit organization is, in
essence, an organization that is barred from distributing its net
earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such
as members, officers, directors, or trustees.\textquotedblright \footnote{In practice, nonprofit firms also enjoy certain benefits that are
denied to for-profit firms (see, for example, Cohen, 2015). But for the purposes of Hansmann's (and our) argument,
it is the \textit{restrictions}, not benefits, that generate improved
outcomes.} \citet{glaeser_not-for-profit_2001} have formalized Hansmann's central
argument to show that when a firm cannot commit to maintaining high
quality, it might choose to operate as a commercial nonprofit rather
than as an investor-led for-profit in order to credibly signal that
it has weaker incentives to cheat the consumer on aspects of unobserved
product quality. As Hansmann describes it, firm ownership form adapts
endogenously as a ``crude form of consumer protection'' in unregulated
emerging markets where asymmetric information problems are rife. \citet{bubb_consumer_2013}
modify this model so that the non-contractible quality issue is on
hidden penalties, which are incurred with certainty by some borrowers.
All of these models are built rely on some form of asymmetric information
or contract verification problem.

A contribution of our paper is to argue that a theory of ownership
form can be built on behavioral micro-foundations even in environments
with no asymmetric information and with sophisticated forward-looking
agents. We believe this is an important element for understanding
the development of consumer finance in developed countries historically
as well as the current shape of microfinance today where non-profit
and `hybrid' forms still dominate the sector in most developing countries
\citep{cull_microfinance_2009,conning_microfinance_2011}. Hybrid
ownership forms include the many microfinance firms that, though technically
incorporated as for-profit financial service providers, are in fact
dominated by boards where, by design, social investors or client representatives
exert substantial governance control. Hybrid forms such as these would
appear to confer many of the benefits of non-profit status (specifically,
credible commitment to consumer protection) with fewer of the costs
(in particular, unlike a pure non-profit they can and do issue stock
to outside investors although usually in a manner that does not lead
to challenge control).


\subsubsection{Market Structure and Governance Choice}

Commenting upon a major microfinance crisis in the state of Andhra
Pradesh in India, veteran microfinance investor and market analyst Elizabeth Rhyne 
describes the build up of ``rising debt stress among possibly tens
of thousands of clients, brought on by explosive growth of microfinance
organizations . . .\textquotedblright{} fueled by the rapid inflow
of directed private lending and new equity investors who, because
they ``paid dearly for shares in {[}newly privatized{]} MFIs . .
. needed fast growth to make their investments pay off \citep{rhyne_microfinance:_2011}\textquotedblright{} 

She goes on to lay the blame
on ``poor governance frameworks\textquotedblright\ for behaviors that included  ``loan officers [that] often sell loans to clients already indebted to other organizations.''{} In her view,
Indian MFIs might have avoided their problems and followed the model
of leading microfinance organizations in other countries like Mibanco
(Peru) and Bancosol (Bolivia) which ``were commercialized with a
mix of owners including the original non-governmental organization
(NGO), international social investors (including development banks),
and some local shareholders. The NGOs kept the focus on the mission,
while the international social investors contributed a commercial
orientation, also tempered by social mission.'' These are the types
of hybrid ownership forms, along with nonprofit firms, that we argue
can provide surplus building consumer protection through a reduced
incentive to renegotiate.  Rhyne's argument is that a number of Indian state regulations made it difficult for such hybrid ownership forms  to rise organically in India. As our model makes clear, these
governance choices are highly dependent on market structure, and nonprofits
may survive better under monopoly than under competition.





\section{The Model: Setup}


\subsection{Consumers and financial intermediaries}

There are three periods, $t\in\left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $. In any period
$t$ the consumer's instantaneous utility from consumption level $c_t$ is given by a CRRA function
defined over all positive consumption: 
\begin{equation}
u\left(c_{t}\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{c_{t}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho} & \mbox{if \ensuremath{\rho>0\mbox{ and }\rho\neq1}}\\
ln\left(c_{t}\right) & \mbox{if \ensuremath{\rho=1}}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Given a consumption stream $C_{t}=\left(c_{t},..,c_{2}\right)$,
the period-$t$ self's discounted utility is: 
\begin{equation}
U_{t}\left(C_{t}\right)\equiv u\left(c_{t}\right)+\beta\sum\limits _{i=t+1}^{2}\delta^{i-t}u\left(c_{i}\right)\label{eq:obj}
\end{equation}
This describes quasi-hyperbolic preferences  with a hyperbolic discount
factor $\beta\in(0,1]$.
In any period \(t\), the individual, or more accurately their period-t self, places greater relative weight on present-period consumption
than her earlier selves would have done. The consumer
could be sophisticated or naive about anticipating the time-inconsistency of her preferences \citep{odonoghue_choice_2001}.
\footnote{ a naive consumer believes her future selves to be exponential discounters with a discount factor of delta.}

Short labels names will help distinguish between the consumer's selves: the  period-zero consumer will be labeled her `Zero-self' or simply `Zero' and her  period-one incarnation as her `One-self' or `One'. 
Zero-self begins  with an endowment of claims to an arbitrary
income stream over the three periods, $Y_{0}=\left(y_{0},y_{1},y_{2}\right)$. Her objective is to rearrange this into a consumption stream $C_0$ to maximize \(U_{0}(C_0)\) in (\ref{eq:obj}) using whatever financial contracting savings and/or borrowing strategies that may be available. 

In the absence of formal banking, she must rely on `own-savings' or informal borrowing, if available. We call this her autarky utility, denoted $U_0^A$. Section \ref{sec-FCC} shows how her optimal autarky utility, $U_0^F$, can be achieved if she has access to borrowing and saving at competitive interest rates, plus commitment. In general, there are many reasons why optimal utility will not be achievable in autarky. If her income is back-heavy, borrowing constraints limit her ability to smooth consumption, and in the absence of credit she must consume her income as it arrives. If her income is front-heavy, with available own-savings strategies the consumer may be able to construct a somewhat better smoothed autarky stream. However there may be technological restrictions to saving as well, with insecurity of storing cash at home being one obvious  explanation. More relevant to our analysis, though, is the fact that even with access to perfectly secure savings, a consumer with time-inconsistent preferences cannot trust her later selves to follow her optimal consumption path \citep[see][and section XXX below]{basu_commitment_2014}. While remaining deliberately agnostic about autarky technologies, the rest of the  paper focuses on  the more reasonable and interesting case where $U_0^A \leq U_0^F$ and there are therefore potential gains to financial contracting with a new intermediary. 

The consumer has the option of contracting with one or many
risk-neutral banks, depending on whether the market structure is monopolized or competitive. Each bank can 
access funds that can be withdrawn from other investments at interest rate opportunity cost $r$, which for most of the analysis we normalize to \(r=0\).
A bank will participate and offer a contract if and only if the profits it can earn, $\Pi_0(C_0,Y_0)$, are expected to be non-negative.\footnote{where $\Pi_0(C_0,Y_0)=\sum\limits _{i=t}^{2} \frac{\left(y_{t}-c_{t}\right)}{\left(1+r\right)^i}$ }
Because the remainder of the analysis will be focused on contracts that attempt to establish self-control, or that  limit the consumer's later period selves' ability to recontract with the same or new financial intermediary, it will be important to distinguish legal or institutional environments that allow banks to establish exclusive contracts with customers and those that do not. \ We will analyze these cases in turn.  




\subsection{Full-commitment contracts under Competition}\label{sec-FCC} 
As a benchmark, we first derive the Zero-self's utility maximizing consumption stream. A consumer with time-inconsistent preferences cannot trust her later selves to stick to her preferred consumption plans.  In this simple three-period setting Zero's  concern is that her later One-self will try to divert resources earmarked for period 2 consumption to boost period 1 consumption instead. 
Like a Stackelberg-Cournot game, Zero's strategic contracting choices are affected by her anticipation of One's best response. 
A bank may be able to act as a strategic partner to Zero by offering
contracts
with commitment services
 to  help restrict or otherwise control the consumer's later self(ves)'s recontracting possibilities.  

In this section we study the benchmark competitive full-commitment contract where we simply assume a bank can \textit{costlessly} offer Zero-self a
multi-period contract that  binds the consumer's latter self(ves) to not renegotiate its terms with the same bank or other banks. Although we are not making the exact mechanisms explicit yet the bank's ability to credibly commit to not renegotiate such a contract must rest on the assumption that the bank has credibly bonded itself to paying a high renegotiation penalty (call it $\kappa$) in the event of renegotiation and that this penalty is sufficiently high to deter the bank.
In later sections of the paper we will examine what happens when  $\kappa$ falls to zero. Then exogenously sustained commitment contracts can no longer be sustained and must be replaced by second-best self-enforcing renegotiation-proof contracts. \ With that understanding we can then move to studying imperfect commitment contracts where $\kappa$ may be larger than zero but less than what is required to sustain full commitment. We can then delve deeper into what in  practice determines $\kappa$ and how it might be  endogenously determined via choices of bank ownership and governance forms, and shaped by the nature of the market structure.

  \end{figure}


With an exclusive full-commitment contract the consumer faces no self control problem. Zero chooses a  contract that costlessly commits her One- and Two- selves to follow the chosen consumption plan. This contract design problem is solved as a standard utility maximization problem subject to an   inter-temporal budget constraint
(or subject to a financial intermediary's zero-profit condition). Zero-self chooses contract \(C_0\) to solve:
\begin{displaymath}
 \max_{C_0} U_0(C_{0})
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath} 
s.t. \quad \Pi_0(C_0,Y_0) \geq 0
\end{displaymath}
The familiar first-order necessary conditions are: 
\begin{equation}
u'\left(c_{0}\right)=\beta \delta (1+r) u'\left(c_{1}\right)=\beta \delta^2 (1+r)^2u'\left(c_{2}\right)  \label{eq:FOC_comp} 
\end{equation}

 Along with a binding budget constraint these equations allow us to solve for the optimal  competitive `full-commitment' contract $C_0^{F}$ so called because latter period selves are committed to not change it. Conceptually the equilibrium contract will be found at the tangency between the highest iso-utility surface  just touching the budget hyper-plane. A 3D graphical analysis would be possible but is cumbersome so we draw insights from 2D contour projections instead.         

With CRRA utility these three equations can be rewritten:
\begin{equation} 
c_1=[\beta\delta(1+r)]^\frac{1}{\rho}c_{0}   \label{eq:FOCc0c1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
c_2=[\delta^{2}(1+r)^{2}]^\frac{1}{\rho}c_{1} \label{eq:FOCc1c2}
\end{equation} 
This last equation and the budget constraint can be combined to give:
\begin{equation}
c_1=\frac{\sum y -c_0}{1+[\delta (1+r)]^\frac{2}{\rho}} \label{eq:budgetplus}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:FOCc0c1} and \ref{eq:budgetplus} allow us to solve for $c_0$ and then  the remaining periods.  An increase or decrease to the term $\delta (1+r),$ which enters each expression above, essentially `tilts' consumption to be more generally rising or falling over time as  $\delta \gtreqless 1/(1+r)$.  As this across-the-board level of tilt will not alter key tradeoffs of interest (unlike the degree of present-bias $\beta$ parameter which will)  we shall, without loss of generality,  impose the assumption that  \(\delta=\frac{1}{1+r}\) for the remainder of the analysis. \ This will unclutter the math. A closed form solution for \(C_{0}\) is easily found: 

\begin{equation}
c_0^{F} = \frac{\sum y}{1+2\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}} \\ \label{eq:CF}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
c_1^{F} = c_2^{F} = \beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_0^{F}
\end{equation*}



In words: Zero-self wants to indulge her present bias to tilt consumption toward period zero consumption but to then allocate to assure even consumption across the remaining two periods. 

These relationships and Zero's preferred contract solution can be seen in the diagrams of Figure \ref{fig:twoquad},  drawn for a consumer with $\beta = 0.5$ and $\rho=1$ and a present value of income \(\sum y_t=300\) spread over the three periods (we are assuming \(r=0\)).\footnote{These parameter values are chosen for expositional purposes. In particular  $\rho=1$ implies that period zero consumption will  remain the same with or without self-control which slightly simplifies the graphical exposition\ (by placing points F and P along the same first period budget line) but the analysis is easily adapted to other cases.} 
The figure provides a novel way to illustrate the strategic nature of savings and borrowing decisions under time-inconsistency.

THIS\ SECTION\ NEEDS\ REWRITING:Zero-self anticipates One-self's best-response function, which is determined by her preferences and the freedom afforded to her.
Zero-self must satisfy a first-order condition (marginal utility of consumption today equal to marginal utility from future consumption) and a budget constraint. These two conditions are shown on the right, and their intersection determines $c_0$ and $c_1$.

The left-hand side follows through with period 1's best response, which is again determined by the intersection of (1) a budget constraint and (2) a condition that determines the optimal relationship between c1 and c2. Under full commitment, the optimal relationship is restricted to c1=c2 as selected by Zero-

The right hand is drawn in $c_0-c_1$ contract space.  Points along the ray $\emph{OF}$ satisfy first-order equation \ref{eq:FOCc0c1} while points along the ray $\emph{yF}$ satisfy  the second tangency equation \ref{eq:FOCc1c2}  and  the budget line (i.e. they satisfy equation  \ref{eq:budgetplus}).\footnote{ A note on diagram interpretations may be helpful.  Points that satisfy the first-order conditions lie along a ray from the origin that extends in the $(1,\beta^\frac{1}{\rho},\beta^\frac{1}{\rho})$ direction in 3D space. The ray through OF in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:twoquad} is the  projection of this ray in  $c_1-c_2$ space.  As contracts are consumption bundles over three periods an iso-utility surface associated with a particular level of inter-temporal utility level given by $u(c_0)+\beta[u(c_1)+u(c_2)]=\hat U$. Projected onto   $c_0-c_1$ space this would be described by an entire family of contour lines, each contour line associated with a slice of the surface at a particular value of $c_2$. A contour line further from the origin in this   $c_0-c_1$ projection does no correspond to higher utility since every contour line in this projection is associated with the same level of utility.  The left hand panel of the figure --  shown in greater detail in Figure \ref{fig:c1c2} -- on the other hand depicts the particular subgame reached when  period 0 consumption was already set at $c_0=c_0^F$. The contour lines drawn in this figure are interpreted as conventional indifference curves with  higher levels of utility as we move further from the origin.  For example Zero's indifference curve $u(c_0^{F})+\beta[u(c_1)+u(c_2)]= U(C^F)$ is the locus of all points $(c_1,c_2)$ that yield the same level of utility to Zero as the full-commitment contract when $c_0=c_0^F$.  Zero's indifference curve passing through point P on the other hand also keeps  $c_0=c_0^F$ but offers an everywhere lower level of utility to Zero. The steeper indifference curves on the same diagram correspond to One's more present-biased preferences $u(c_0^{F})+ u(c_1)+\beta u(c_2)$}   The intersection at F identifies the coordinates $(c_0^F,c_1^F)$ of Zero's preferred contract, also given by equation \ref{eq:CF}. We've labeled this with subscript F to indicate it's essential similarity to the full-commitment contract that might be offered by a competitive bank. The left hand panel depicts the situation in $c_1-c_2$ space of the sliced plane  at $c_0=c_0^F$). This last diagram can be seen, now rotated 90 degrees to place \(c_{1}\) on the horizontal axis, in Figure \ref{fig:c1c2}.  Points along ray OF satisfy the Euler equation \ref{eq:FOCc1c2}, while points along the line passing through DF satisfy the period 1 budget $c_1+c_2=\sum y - c_0^$ where as drawn $c_0=c_0^F$. Point F at the intersection of these lines identifies the coordinates $(c_1^F,c_2^F)$ of the optimal contract.

\end{figure}

Zero's preferred contract
at these parameters is $C_0^F=(150, 75, 75)$. How much the consumer borrows or saves\ (or pays down debts)\  in any given period  depends on the value of her income in that period relative the optimal consumption level in that period.   If total income of 300 were evenly divided across periods as $Y_{0}=(100, 100, 100)$ then this   consumption plan would be achieved by borrowing $c_0-y_0=50$ in period 0 and repaying  25 in each of periods 1 and 2 (recall \(r=0)\). If the  stream were instead $Y_{0}=(200, 50, 50)$ the same consumption plan would be constructed by saving  50 in period 0 to be evenly allocated to raise consumption in periods 1 and 2.  


\section{The Renegotiation Problem}




One-self would like  higher period 1 consumption than Zero's preferences built into the contract. This will mean that are potential gains to trade to be split between the bank the One-self by breaking earlier commitments. In the last section we simply assumed there were  sufficiently high costlessly enforced penalties that  deterred he bank from breaking such commitments. 

 

Consider now then a competitive situation where  there no penalties to the bank from breaking commitments    and/or a situation where non-exclusivity clauses cannot be enforced so nothing stops the consumer from refinancing with another bank, for example taking out a second loan. 

When period 1 arrives One-self will want to indulge her present-bias and  increase period 1  consumption relative to Zero's preferences. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:c1c2}. Assume for the sake of argument that the consumer had (naively as it will turn out) accepted the contract \(C_0^F\) in period zero. At the start of period 1 this contract satisfies Zero-self's optimality condition $u'(c_1^F)=u'(c_2^F)$ but from the standpoint of One's preferences it involves not enough period 1 consumption as $u'(c_1^{0F})\geq \beta u'(c_2^{0F})$. This can be seen at point F, where Zero-self's indifference curve is tangent to the budget line but One-self's indifference curve is steeper than the budget line. The One-self can gain by recontracting to any new tangency point above where their indifference curve through F cuts the $c_2=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_1$ ray (at point R  -- the point they'd be driven to if in period 1 they could only refinance with  a monopoly bank)\ and   below the budget line (at point P -- the point they'd recontract to with competiive choices).\footnote{ When $\rho=1$ (as is drawn in Figure \ref{fig:c1c2})   Zero will want to choose the same period 0 consumption level as the full-commitment contract. When $\rho \neq 1$ this will not be the case and the renegotiation-proof contract P will no longer lie exactly on the budget line defined by $c_0+c_1=\sum y - c_0^F$. The analysis is readily adapted.} As the gains to trade are positive One can entice the bank to refinance by offering to compensate the bank for any renegotiation costs $\kappa$ (at the moment assumed to be zero) less than that amount.  From Zero's standpoint the bank would be opportunistically profiting by pandering to One-self's impulse to `raid savings' or `roll over or pile on new debt.'   

As a sophisticate    Zero anticipates how any such  recontracting could   lower their inter-temporal welfare\footnote{A naive hyperbolic discounter, on the other hand, may believe she
can achieve optimal utility though this will not be realized. See below.}. From the diagram it should be clear that Zero can do no better  to limit the damage than to accept the contract at P (as any other preferred contract is not subgame-perfect and would be recontracted to P anyways).  The subgame-perfect `renegotiation-proof' contract will involve less net saving (or same thing, more net debt) in period 1 than Zero-self would like (as can be seen by $u'(c_1^{P})<  u'(c_2^{P})$) and lower Zero-self welfare compared to the full-commitment contract.


The problem is like a Stackelberg game with Zero-self moving first to choose a contract in anticipation of One-self's best response recontracting. }   
Consider the subgame entered following Zero's choice of contract \(C^{0}=(c_0^0, c_1^0,c_2^0)    \). One-self can now either accept the remaining consumption plan  $(c_1^0,c_2^0)$ or exchange it for a new contract to solve
\begin{align}
   \max_{c_1,c_2}  u(c_1)+\beta u(c_2) \\
    s.t. \text{   } c_1+c_2 \leq c_1^0 +c_2^0
\end{align}

As Zero-self's budget constraint must bind at an optimum (otherwise consumption and utility could be increased) the period 1 budget can be rewritten
\begin{equation}
 c_1+c_2 \leq \sum y -c_0^0
\end{equation}
from which it becomes clear that One-self needs to react only to Zero's period zero consumption $c_0^0^$ as establishes the remainin resource claims to be divided between consumption in period 1 and 2.  From equation \ref{eq:budgetplus} we know that Zero would like that on the margin each extra unit that it passes forward into period 1 be divided equally between period 1 and period 2 consumption (in Figure \ref{fig:twoquad} the slope of the line through yF has a slope \(\frac{dc_1}{dc_0}=\frac{1}{2}\) and OF has a slope $\frac{dc_2}{dc_1}=1$).

One wants to re-arrange this plan to satisfy her preferences captured by the first-order condition $c_2=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_1$. Substitute this into the binding period one budget allows us to derive One's best response function to Zero's period 0 consumption choice:
\begin{align}
c_1^{1}(c_0^0) &=\frac{\sum y - c_0^0}{1+\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}} \label{eq:react1}
\\
c_2^{1}(c_0^0) &=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}\cdot c_1^{1}(c_0^0) \label{eq:react2}
\end{align}
One's reaction function can be visualized as the line passing through yP in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:twoquad} (from expression \ref{eq:react1})\ and the line passing through OP' in the left (from \ref{eq:react2}). 

 Being sophisticated, Zero anticipates her future self's reaction and  strategically chooses $c_0^$ to solve:
\begin{equation}
\max_{c_0} u(c_0)+\beta[u(c_1^{1}(c_0)+u(c_2^{1}(c_{0})]\\  
\end{equation}
subject to the bank's period 0 participation (or zero-profit) constraint
 \begin{equation}
 c_0+ c_1^{1}(c_0)+ c_2^{1}(c_0)= \sum y
\end{equation}
Using the fact that One wants to set $c_2^{1}=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_1^{1}$ and other substitutions the first-order condition for this problem can be written:
\begin{align}
u'(c_0)&=\Lambda u'(c_1) \nonumber \\
\text{    or    }
c_1&=\Lambda^\frac{1}{\rho}c_0 \label{eq:LambdaC0}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda=\frac{(\beta+\beta^\frac{1}{\rho})}{1+\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:LambdaC0} defines the line passing through OP.   For $0<\beta< 1,$ line OP is everywhere steeper than line OF'.

In analogy to a classic Stackelberg Cournot duopoly game,  Zero-self chooses the consumption contract  along One's reaction function that places her on the highest possible iso-utility surface. The equilibrium contract \(P \text{ }\)satisfies both equation \ref{eq:react1} (the line through yP) and equation \ref{eq:LambdaC0} (the line through OP). These equations can be solved to yield the closed-form solution to the optimal contract
\begin{equation}
c_0^P = \frac{\sum y}{1+\Lambda^\frac{1}{\rho}(1+\beta^\frac{1}{\rho})}\label{eq:coP} 
\end{equation}
with $c_1^P=\Lambda^\frac{1}{\rho}c_0^P$ and $c_2^P=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho} \Lambda^\frac{1}{\rho}c_0^P$. 

It is easy to check that $\Lambda>\beta$ for all $0<\beta < 1$ and hence that line OP is everywhere steeper  than line OF.   Combined with our earlier observation that line yP
is everywhere steeper than line YF
allows us to conclude that $c_1^P>c_1^F$ over the same parameter range. Hence, the inability to enforce commitment leads to higher consumption in period one compared to a situation where it can be enforced. 

A little more algebra reveals that for all  $0<\beta<1$ we will have $c_0^P\gtreqless c_0^F$ as $\rho \lesseqgtr 1$  and $c_2^P<c_2^F$.  That means that when $\rho<1$
 and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution $\frac{1}{\rho}$ is high Zero  will respond to the failure of commitment by allocating less resources to period 1 and 2 consumption -- saving less or borrowing more in period 0. When  $\rho>1$ she responds by allocating $\emph{more}$ resources -- saving more or borrowing less in period 0.  Period 2 consumption however always falls relative to the full commitment case, even in the cases when Zero acts saves more/borrows less. In fact for  CRRA utility the adjustment of period 0 consumption (in the absence of commitment compared to with commitment) is  always relatively small while the adjustment to period 1 and period 2 consumption is relatively much larger.\footnote{To illustrate, at no point does period 0 consumption rise or fall by more than six percent for any value $\rho \in (0,\infty)$ and $\beta \in (0,1)$  but at reasonable parameter values such as  $\rho=0.5$ and $\beta=0.5 $ in the absence of commitment period 1 consumption rises to 149 percent of the level it would be with commitment, and period 2 consumption falls to just 37 percent of what it would be.}   In other words despite having a first-mover advantage, Zero can do little much other than to  largely accommodate to the  consumption pattern that One-self wants to impose. There is little Zero can do to ameliorate the self-control problem on their own -- hence her demand for more effective commitment services from a bank.  

To illustrate, at our earlier parameterization $\beta=0.5$ and $\rho=1$ the full commitment contract will be $C_0^P=(150, 100, 50) $ which offers considerably less consumption smoothing in later periods compared to the contract with self-control $C_0^F=(150, 75, 75) $.\footnote{For these parameters  expression \ref{eq:coP} becomes $c_{0}^P =\frac{\sum y}{1+2\beta}, c_1^P=\beta\cdot c_{0}^P \text{ and } $ c_1^P=\beta^2\cdot c_{0}^P }  If the consumer's  initial income stream were $Y_0=(100, 100, 100)$ then we could think of the consumer with self-control as sticking to a balanced repayment program to keep consumption steady in the last two periods. Compared to this the consumer without self-control  rolls over debt rather than repay it in period one. The entire burden of repayment of the debt that Zero took out in period 0 now falls in period 2, whereas Zero would have preferred the burden to be shared equally between periods 1 and 2. If the income stream had instead been $Y_0=(200, 50, 50)$ then a consumer without self-control would be  viewed as raiding   savings in period 1 that an otherwise identical consumer with self-control would have earmarked for period 2 consumption. In short, consumers that can obtain full-commitment contracts will save/repay more or borrow less in period 1 and consume more in period 2 and the inability to do so leads to lower welfare for Zero in this competitive setting.

\subsection{The Bank's no-renegotiation constraint} 

There are potential gains to trade between the bank and the One-self consumer from renegotiating the contract.  The bank's promise in period 0 to not renegotiate the contract in period 1 will be credible only as long as any such potential gains from replacing the remaining terms $(c_1,c_2)$ of the contract $C_0$
by a lower-cost renegotiated contract $(c_1^1,c_2^1)$ do not exceed the costs of  renegotiating $\kappa$: 

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{1}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa \label{eq:no_reneg}
\end{equation}Or more simply:  
\begin{displaymath}
c_1+c_2-(c_1^1+c_2^1)\leq \kappa
\end{displaymath}
In this competitive setting the renegotiated terms $(c_1^1,c_2^1)$ will be given by the consumer's best reaction to $(c_1,c_2)$ described in equations \ref{eq:react1} and \ref{eq:react2}. If in period 1 the consumer can shop around before renegotiating the contract (the case if contracts are non-exclusive and the market for period 1 refinance is competitive) then the consumer will capture all the gains to trade. At the other extreme, if the consumer has no choice in period 1 but to renegotiate with the same bank under conditions of monopoly (which might be the case even had there been competition for enforceable exclusive contracts in period 0) then these gains to trade will be instead captured by the monopolist and $(c_1^1,c_2^1)$ would be  replaced by best response functions  $(c_1^{m1},c_2^{m2})$ described in a subsection below.

When we assumed a full-commitment contract can be costlessly offered we implicitly assumed that $\kappa$ is exogenous and sufficiently large as to make the constraint always satisfied at an optimum. Under the opposite competitive ``no commitment'' scenario without exclusivity banks renegotiate contracts at zero profit so with $\kappa=0$ the constraint is just satisfied. 
The core of the remainder of the paper concentrates on understanding the more interesting case where $\kappa>0$ but not so large as to allow the full-commitment optimum, along with the question of the costly actions firms might take to shape $\kappa$.  However, before we analyze this in more detail, we must first expand the framework to monopoly contracts.

\subsection{Full-commitment contracts under Monopoly}
\label{sec:own}

 This is similar to the competitive full-commitment contract above except that the consumer's discounted utility objective function and the firm's zero-profit participation constraints are now reversed. The
bank solves the following problem:
\begin{align}
\max_{C_0} & \; \Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & \; U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\geq U_{0}^{A}\label{eq:PC}
\end{align}
where $U_{0}^{A}$ is the reservation utility the consumer would enjoy if they did not accept the contract.  For the moment we shall adopt the simple assumption that without a bank contract the consumer has access to no good saving or borrowing opportunities and therefore has no choice but to consume their autarky income stream so  $U_{0}^{A}=u(y_0)+\beta[u(y_1)+u(y_2)]$. We will later relax this assumption to explore how equilibrium contracts may change when the consumer has access to some consumption smoothing opportunities under autarky. As before, the no-renegotiation constraint \ref{eq:no_reneg} is also part of the problem but in the full-commitment case is  assumed to be satisfied by assuming $\kappa$  is large enough.

The first-order tangency conditions  are just as expressions \ref{eq:FOC_comp} from the competitive case. Under the sustained assumption that $\delta= 1/(1+r)$ and $r=0$ these are:\begin{equation}
u'\left(c_{0}\right)=\beta u'\left(c_{1}\right)=\beta u'\left(c_{2}\right)
\end{equation}and with CRRA utility simply $c_1=c_{2}=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_{0}$.
These equations alon with the fact that Zero's participation constraint must bind at a monopoly optimum allow us to  solve for the optimum monopoly full-commitment contract $C_{0}^{mF}$ and corresponding bank profits $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{mF};Y_{0}\right)$. Closed form solutions for the CRRA utility case appear as appendix equations \ref{eq:c-mf} and \ref{eq:pi-mf}, respectively. Conceptually, the optimum contract will be at the tangency point where the highest iso-profit plane still touches the iso-utility surface associated with Zero's reservation utility. 
Figure \ref{fig:renegotiation} depicts the equilibrium contract at point $mF $ in the $c_1-c_2$ sliced plane defined by by $c_0=c_0^{mF}$.

The terms of the optimal monopoly contract, and hence also the level of bank
profits achieved will be dependent on the consumer's autarky utility. The bank makes non-negative profits. The present value of $ C_{0}^{mF}$
rises and profits fall with $U_{0}^{A}$. 


\subsection{Renegotiation-proof monopoly contracts}
 

The  renegotiation-problem in the monopoly bank case is very similar but now the inability of the bank to credibly commit to not opportunistically renegotiate the contract  will cost the bank. To see this, assume again for argument's sake that Zero had agreed to the full-commitment contract indicated by point $mF$ in the figure. 
At the start of period 1 this contract satisfies Zero-self's optimality condition $u'(c_1^{mF})=u'(c_2^{mF})$ but from the standpoint of One's preferences involves not enough period 1 consumption as $u'(c_1^{mF})\geq \beta u'(c_2^{mF})$. The monopolist Bank can gain  by pandering to One's present bias recontracting to point R  along the $c_2=\beta^\frac{1}{\rho}c_1$ ray. If such a recontracting took place the bank would have succeeded in actually pushing Zero's intertemporal utility \textit{below} her reservation utility (which was just met at F). However the sophisticated customer of course anticipates this and will therefore only agree to `renegotiation-proof' contracts in period 0 that protect against this type of opportunistic recontracting.
Profits can only be lowered by displacing the equilibrium contract from the optimum at $mF$. 


\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_monopoly.pdf}
\caption{The monopoly renegotiation problem}\label{fig:renegotiation}

\end{figure}








Consider the renegotiation problem at the start of a subgame in period 1. A customer who has agreed to contract $C_{0}$ in period 0 enters
period 1 with claims to the remaining consumption stream $C_{1}$.
This determines the new reservation utility. If profitable to the
bank, the optimal renegotiated contract will be chosen in period 1
to solve:
\begin{align}
\max_{C_1^{m,r}} \text{ } & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r};C_{1}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & U_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\right)\geq U_{1}\left(C_{1}\right)\label{eq:pc-r}
\end{align}
and the renegotiation-proof constraint \ref{eq:no_reneg}, which for the moment we assume has $\kappa =0$, so there is no direct cost to renegotiating in period 1. The bank offers $C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right)\equiv\left(c_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right),c_{2}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right)\right)$
 to replace\footnote{The bank in effect swaps net income stream $\left(y_{1}-c_{1},y_{2}-c_{2}\right)$
for $(y_{1}-c_{1}^{r},y_{2}-c_{2}^{r})$.} the contractually agreed $C_{1}$ set in period 0. Since the first-order conditions
imply $u^{\prime}\left(c_{1}^{m,r}\right)=\beta u^{\prime}\left(c_{2}^{m,r}\right)$,
the contract will set $c_{1}^{m,r}>c_{2}^{m,r}$. This also determines
the maximum possible profits from renegotiation, $\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)$. Close form solutions are in the appendix.

In Figure \ref{fig:renegotiation} point R is the renegotiated contract
that would be offered in the very special case of a customer who had agreed to a full-commitment contract in period 0 only
to find herself genuinely and unexpectedly surprised to find the bank
reneging on the promise by offering to renegotiate in period 1. Such commitment-breaking will be
weakly profitable unless the contract satisfies the renegotiation-proof constraint 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa
\end{equation} In Figure \ref{fig:renegotiation},
the bank will find it profitable to offer to renegotiate from what is left of the
full commitment contract at point $F$
to the new contract depicted by $R$ as  long as profits gains $NQ$
on the diagram are greater than $\kappa$.

We show in the appendix that, if the original contract offers full
commitment ($c_{1}=c_{2}$), profits from renegotiation rise strictly
in $C_{1}$. The larger the consumption in periods 1 and 2, the greater
the scope for rearranging consumption profitably. Also, since $C_{1}^{mF}$
rises in $U_{0}^{A}$, full commitment becomes less sustainable if
$U_{0}^{A}$ is sufficiently large. 


\subsection{When Full Commitment contracts fail}

In the case just discussed we implicitly assumed that when the customer enters the subgame
she recontracts with the same monopoly bank that she entered into contract with in period 0 and that bank again enjoyed a monopoly position.  In effect we assumed that the period 0 contract was enforceably exclusive. 

 If we make the very different assumption that new banks can enter compete to offer recontracts with the consumer in period 1 (and hence the bank cannot enforce the exclusivity of contracts), any renegotiated contract will now solve:
\begin{align}
\underset{C_{1}^{c,r}}{\mbox{\ensuremath{max}}} & U_{1}\left(C_{1}^{c,r}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{c,r};C_{1}\right)\geq\kappa\label{eq:bpc-r}
\end{align}
This yields a different reaction function $C_{1}^{c,r}\left(C_{1}\right)$,
which returns all new gains to trade to the period 1 agent, resulting in higher
consumption than if contracts were exclusive.

A full-commitment monopoly contract will survive if and only if there is no
way for the monopolist or a new bank to offer One a new contract that (a) leaves her with at least
as much discounted utility as in the original contract, and (b) generates
additional profits of at least $\kappa$ to the bank offering the
new contract. We can make two observations about these conditions.
First, they apply identically whether contracts are exclusive or not.
Second, since full-commitment contracts under competition do not vary
with autarky utility, the survival of full-commitment is also independent
of autarky utility (unlike under monopoly). So there will be some
$\bar{\kappa}$ such that full-commitment contracts will not be renegotiated
if and only if $\kappa\geq\bar{\kappa}$ (equation \ref{eq:max-kappa}).\footnote{We assume contracts are renegotiated only if strictly preferred by
the bank (monopoly) or consumer (competition).}
\begin{prop}
If $\kappa\geq\bar{\kappa}$, then full-commitment contracts survive
under both monopoly and competition. If $\kappa<\bar{\kappa}$, then: 

(a) There is some $U^{m}<U_{0}^{*}$ such that the monopolist full
commitment contract $C_{0}^{m,fc}$ will be renegotiated if and only
if $U_{0}^{A}\epsilon(U^{m},U_{0}^{*})$.

(b) The competitive full commitment contract $C_{0}^{c,fc}$ will
be renegotiated at any $U_{0}^{A}$.\footnote{All proofs are in the appendix.}
\end{prop}
An implication is that, under monopoly, consumers with already relatively
smooth consumption are more likely to get full-commitment contracts
that can be sustained. The comparison between monopoly and competition
is perhaps more subtle than it appears. Intuitively, one might expect
monopoly to sustain commitment better than competition because of
differential abilities to commit--the monopolist can promise not to
renegotiate while no such promise is possible under competition. In
the language of our model, this would be equivalent to competitive
firms facing a lower $\kappa$ than the monopolist. That may indeed
be the case, but our result points to another mechanism that survives
even when the costs of renegotiation are identical across market structures.
Here, the monopolist's superior ability to commit comes from the fact
that its commitment contract is itself less susceptible to renegotiation.
Having, at the outset, offered the consumer a contract with the lowest
possible consumption, there is relatively less for the firm to gain
by renegotiating in period 1.

Note that in the special case of $\kappa=0$, \emph{any} full-commitment
contract would be subject to renegotiation.
To make the continuing analysis interesting, we assume that $\kappa<\bar{\kappa}$.



\section{Imperfect Commitment Contracts $(0\leq\kappa<\bar{\kappa})$}

Having characterized the renegotiation problem, and conditions for
the survival of full commitment contracts, we turn to the cases where
the renegotiation-proof constraint \ref{eq:no_reneg} binds. We call
these imperfect commitment contracts. For sophisticated hyperbolic
discounters, contracts will be informed by their ability to anticipate
possible renegotiation (4.1 and 4.2). For naifs, banks will capitalize
on the consumer's failure to do the same (4.3).

To illustrate the strategic nature of Zero-self's choice, we turn
to the special case of perfect competition with $\kappa=0$ (Figure
1b). As a sophisticate, Zero anticipates how any period 1 recontracting
of a full commitment contract could lower her inter-temporal welfare\footnote{A naive hyperbolic discounter, on the other hand, may believe she
can achieve optimal utility though this will not be realized. See
below.}. From the diagram it should be clear that Zero can do no better to
limit the damage than to accept the contract at P (as any other preferred
contract is not subgame-perfect and would be recontracted to P anyways).
The subgame-perfect `renegotiation-proof' contract will involve less
net saving (or equivalently, more net debt) in period 1 than Zero
self would like (as can be seen by $u'(c_{1}^{P})<u'(c_{2}^{P})$)
and lower Zero self welfare compared to the full-commitment contract.

The problem is like a Stackelberg game with Zero-self moving first
to choose a contract in anticipation of One-self's best response recontracting.
Consider the subgame entered following Zero's choice of contract $C_{0}=(c_{0}^{0},c_{1}^{0},c_{2}^{0})$.
One self can now either accept the remaining consumption plan $(c_{1}^{0},c_{2}^{0})$
or exchange it for a new contract to solve 
\begin{align}
\max_{c_{1},c_{2}}u(c_{1})+\beta u(c_{2})\\
s.t.\text{ }c_{1}+c_{2}\leq c_{1}^{0}+c_{2}^{0}
\end{align}

As Zero-self's budget constraint must bind at an optimum (otherwise
consumption and utility could be increased) the period 1 budget can
be rewritten 
\begin{equation}
c_{1}+c_{2}\leq\sum y-c_{0}^{0}
\end{equation}
from which it becomes clear that One-self needs to react only to Zero's
period zero consumption $c_{0}^{0}{}^{\ensuremath{}}$ as this establishes
the remaining resource claims to be divided between consumption in
period 1 and 2. From equation \ref{eq:budgetplus} we know that Zero
would like that on the margin each extra unit that it passes forward
into period 1 be divided equally between period 1 and period 2 consumption
(in Figure \ref{fig:twoquad} the slope of the line through yF has
a slope $\frac{dc_{1}}{dc_{0}}=\frac{1}{2}$ and OF has a slope $\frac{dc_{2}}{dc_{1}}=1$).

One wants to re-arrange this plan to satisfy her preferences captured
by the first-order condition $c_{2}=\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{1}$.
Substitute this into the binding period one budget allows us to derive
One's best response function to Zero's period 0 consumption choice:
\begin{align}
c_{1}^{1}(c_{0}^{0}) & =\frac{\sum y-c_{0}^{0}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\label{eq:react1}\\
c_{2}^{1}(c_{0}^{0}) & =\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\cdot c_{1}^{1}(c_{0}^{0})\label{eq:react2}
\end{align}
One's reaction function can be visualized as the line passing through
yP in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:twoquad} (from expression
\ref{eq:react1})\ and the line passing through OP' in the left (from
\ref{eq:react2}).

Being sophisticated, Zero anticipates her future self's reaction and
strategically chooses $c_{0}^{\ensuremath{}}$ to solve: 
\begin{equation}
\max_{c_{0}}u(c_{0})+\beta[u(c_{1}^{1}(c_{0})+u(c_{2}^{1}(c_{0})]
\end{equation}
subject to the bank's period 0 participation (or zero-profit) constraint
\begin{equation}
c_{0}+c_{1}^{1}(c_{0})+c_{2}^{1}(c_{0})=\sum y
\end{equation}
Using the fact that One wants to set $c_{2}^{1}=\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{1}^{1}$
and other substitutions the first-order condition for this problem
can be written: 
\begin{align}
u'(c_{0}) & =\Lambda u'(c_{1})\nonumber \\
\text{ or }c_{1} & =\Lambda^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{0}\label{eq:LambdaC0}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda=\frac{(\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}})}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:LambdaC0} defines the line passing through OP. For
$0<\beta<1,$ line OP is everywhere steeper than line OF'.

In analogy to a classic Stackelberg Cournot duopoly game, Zero self
chooses the consumption contract along One's reaction function that
places her on the highest possible iso-utility surface. The equilibrium
contract $P\text{ }$satisfies both equation \ref{eq:react1} (the
line through yP) and equation \ref{eq:LambdaC0} (the line through
OP). These equations can be solved to yield the closed-form solution
to the optimal contract 
\begin{equation}
c_{0}^{P}=\frac{\sum y}{1+\Lambda^{\frac{1}{\rho}}(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}})}\label{eq:coP}
\end{equation}
with $c_{1}^{P}=\Lambda^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{0}^{P}$ and $c_{2}^{P}=\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\Lambda^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{0}^{P}$.

It is easy to check that $\Lambda>\beta$ for all $0<\beta<1$ and
hence that line OP is everywhere steeper than line OF. Combined with
our earlier observation that line yP is everywhere steeper than line
YF allows us to conclude that $c_{1}^{P}>c_{1}^{F}$ over the same
parameter range. Hence, the inability to enforce commitment leads
to higher consumption in period one compared to a situation where
it can be enforced.

To illustrate, at our earlier parameterization $\beta=0.5$ and $\rho=1$
the full commitment contract will be $C_{0}^{P}=(150,100,50)$ which
offers considerably less consumption smoothing in later periods compared
to the contract with self-control $C_{0}^{F}=(150,75,75)$.\footnote{For these parameters expression \ref{eq:coP} becomes $c_{0}^{P}=\frac{\sum y}{1+2\beta},c_{1}^{P}=\beta\cdot c_{0}^{P}\text{ and } c1P=\beta2\cdot c{0}P $} If the consumer's initial income stream were $Y_{0}=(100,100,100)$
then we could think of the consumer with self-control as sticking
to a balanced repayment program to keep consumption steady in the
last two periods. Compared to this the consumer without self-control
rolls over debt rather than repay it in period one. The entire burden
of repayment of the debt that Zero took out in period 0 now falls
in period 2, whereas Zero would have preferred the burden to be shared
equally between periods 1 and 2. If the income stream had instead
been $Y_{0}=(200,50,50)$ then a consumer without self-control would
be viewed as raiding savings in period 1 that an otherwise identical
consumer with self-control would have earmarked for period 2 consumption.
In short, consumers that can obtain full-commitment contracts will
save/repay more or borrow less in period 1 and consume more in period
2 and the inability to do so leads to lower welfare for Zero in this
competitive setting.

More generally, if $\kappa$ is small but non-zero, then Zero-self
is not entirely bound to One-self's preferences. In the following
sections, starting with monopoly, we show how the contract terms change
in such cases.

\subsection{Monopoly}

\textendash{}

Consider the renegotiation problem at the start of a subgame in period
1. A customer who has agreed to contract $C_{0}$ in period 0 enters
period 1 with claims to the remaining consumption stream $C_{1}$.
This determines the new reservation utility. If profitable to the
bank, the optimal renegotiated contract will be chosen in period 1
to solve: 
\begin{align}
\max_{C_{1}^{m,r}}\text{ } & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r};C_{1}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & U_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\right)\geq U_{1}\left(C_{1}\right)\label{eq:pc-r}
\end{align}
and the renegotiation-proof constraint \ref{eq:no_reneg}, which for
the moment we assume has $\kappa=0$, so there is no direct cost to
renegotiating in period 1. The bank offers $C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right)\equiv\left(c_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right),c_{2}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right)\right)$
to replace\footnote{The bank in effect swaps net income stream $\left(y_{1}-c_{1},y_{2}-c_{2}\right)$
for $(y_{1}-c_{1}^{r},y_{2}-c_{2}^{r})$.} the contractually agreed $C_{1}$ set in period 0. Since the first-order
conditions imply $u^{\prime}\left(c_{1}^{m,r}\right)=\beta u^{\prime}\left(c_{2}^{m,r}\right)$,
the contract will set $c_{1}^{m,r}>c_{2}^{m,r}$. This also determines
the maximum possible profits from renegotiation, $\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)$.
Close form solutions are in the appendix.

In Figure \ref{fig:renegotiation} point R is the renegotiated contract
that would be offered in the very special case of a customer who had
agreed to a full-commitment contract in period 0 only to find herself
genuinely and unexpectedly surprised to find the bank reneging on
the promise by offering to renegotiate in period 1. Such commitment-breaking
will be weakly profitable unless the contract satisfies the renegotiation-proof
constraint 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa
\end{equation}
In Figure \ref{fig:renegotiation}, the bank will find it profitable
to offer to renegotiate from what is left of the full commitment contract
at point $F$ to the new contract depicted by $R$ as long as profits
gains $NQ$ on the diagram are greater than $\kappa$.

We show in the appendix that, if the original contract offers full
commitment ($c_{1}=c_{2}$), profits from renegotiation rise strictly
in $C_{1}$. The larger the consumption in periods 1 and 2, the greater
the scope for rearranging consumption profitably. Also, since $C_{1}^{mF}$
rises in $U_{0}^{A}$, full commitment becomes less sustainable if
$U_{0}^{A}$ is sufficiently large.

\textendash{}

A sophisticated consumer will rationally anticipate the bank and her
own later self's temptation to break promises and therefore would
reject the contract $C_{0}^{mF}$ if it fails the renegotiation-proofness
conditions laid out in the last section. Since $C_{0}^{mF}$ was designed
to leave the period 0 consumer with autarky utility, any renegotiation
would make her strictly worse off than in autarky. The bank will want
to avoid renegotiation costs $\kappa$ since it can always do better
by simply offering the renegotiated contract as the original contract.
So the only contracts that will be offered must be renegotiation-proof:
contracts that the bank will not find profitable to renegotiate.

The bank must therefore offer a contract that satisfies period 0's
participation constraint and the renegotiation-proofness constraint
\ref{eq:no_reneg}. The resulting contract must limit One-self's (and
hence also the bank's) potential gains from renegotiation. As long
as $\kappa$ is small enough for the constraint to bind, this must
lower bank profits relative to the costless full commitment case because
the monopolist must now compensate the consumer for a contract that
delivers less consumption smoothing across periods 1 and 2.

The monopolist solves the following problem: 
\begin{align}
 & \underset{C_{0}}{max}\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\geq U_{0}^{A}\label{eq:pc-rp}\\
 & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{m,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa\label{eq:rpc-m}
\end{align}

Let us denote the solution $C_{0}^{m,rp}$ (the superscript is for
'monopolist, renegotiation-proof'). The first restriction is the same
participation constraint as before. The second (\ref{eq:rpc-m}) is
a no-renegotiation constraint that states that to be credibly committed
any increase in profits that the bank can gain from renegotiating
the continuation contract from $C_{1}$ to $C_{1}^{m,r}(C_{1})$ must
fall short of the cost of renegotiation cost $\kappa$. The renegotiation-proof
contract can be explicitly derived in the special case of $\kappa=0$
(Equation \ref{eq:zerokappa-monop}).

For, $\kappa>0$, the contract cannot be explicitly derived in closed
form, but its key properties can be established. A convenient way
to interpret the renegotiation-proofness constraint is this: given
any amount $s$ to be split across periods 1 and 2, the constraint
specifies, at a minimum, how much must be allocated to period 1. When
binding, the renegotiation-proofness constraint can be thought of
as yielding functions $c_{1}\left(s\right)$ and $c_{2}\left(s\right)=s-c_{1}\left(s\right)$.
If $c_{1}$ is sufficiently large relative to $c_{2}$ (i.e. the allocation
is sufficiently close to period 1's optimum), the allocation will
not be renegotiated by the bank. We show in the appendix that $c_{1}\left(s\right)>\frac{1}{2}$
and $\frac{dc_{1}\left(s\right)}{ds}>\frac{c_{1}}{s}$. The first
is obvious\textendash when the constraint binds, the bank can no longer
offer full-commitment ($c_{1}=\frac{s}{2}$) and to prevent renegotiation
it must allow period 1 to consume more than period 2 does. The second
result states that, as more is consumed in periods 1 and 2 combined,
the ratio of consumption is forced to skew further in period 1's favor.
This follows from the fact that, if $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ were to
rise in fixed proportions, the bank's profits from renegotiation would
rise. So to prevent renegotiation as $s$ grows, $c_{1}$ would need
to grow disproportionately. 
\begin{prop}
If $U_{0}^{A}\leq U^{m}$, the bank offers the full-commitment contract.
If $U_{0}^{A}>U^{m}$:

(a) $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)<\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)$

(b) There is some $\bar{U}\epsilon\left(U^{m},U_{0}^{*}\right)$ such
that, if $U_{0}^{A}>\bar{U}$, the bank would earn negative profits
and therefore will not offer a contract.

(c) $c_{0}^{m,rp}>c_{0}^{m,fc}$. 
\end{prop}
Proposition 2 compares the renegotiation-proof contract to the full-commitment
contract when the renegotiation-proofness constraint binds. Part (a)
states that bank profits will be lower than under full-commitment.
The bank wishes it could promise to not renegotiate but it cannot
make such a promise credible without giving up some profits. The problem
here is not one of cheating or contract failure (as examined for example
by Hansmann (1980) and Glaeser-Shleifer (2001)), it is the possibility
of a legitimate renegotiation (a voluntary agreement to tear up the
old contract) between the consumer and the firm. The monopolist would
gain from having higher renegotiation costs since in equilibrium renegotiation
does not take place.

Part (b) follows from part (a). If the bank were able to provide full
commitment, it could offer a profit-making contract to any individual
with even minimal smoothing needs. Now however, for individuals whose
autarky utility is close enough to $U_{0}^{*}$, the bank would make
negative profits and therefore no contract is offered to them. This
is because the renegotiation-proofness constraint may require even
greater imbalance in consumption across periods 1 and 2 than under
autarky.

Part (c) is about the terms of the contract itself\textendash when
full-commitment is not feasible; the renegotiation-proof contract
will involve higher consumption in period 0 (i.e. either a smaller
loan or less savings) compared to full commitment). The following
is a sketch of the argument. Let the full-commitment contract be described
by some $c_{0}=c_{0}^{m,fc}$ (period 0 consumption) and $s=s^{m,fc}$
(sum of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, which are equal in size). Since the
full-commitment contract lies at an optimum, it must be true that
at the levels of consumption specified by the contract, the marginal
utility of present consumption is equal to the discounted marginal
utility of future consumption: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{m,fc}\right)}{dc_{0}}=\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(\frac{s^{m,fc}}{2}\right)+\beta u\left(\frac{s^{m,fc}}{2}\right)\right)}{ds}
\end{equation}
Now suppose $c_{0}^{m,rp}=c_{0}^{m,fc}$, so that period 0 consumption
in the renegotiation-proof contract is held the same. Since any future
consumption will be split unevenly, in order to continue to satisfy
the consumer's period 0 participation constraint, it must be true
that $s^{m,rp}>$$s^{m,fc}$. We show in the appendix that $s^{m,rp}$
will be large enough that, regardless of the parameters of the consumer's
utility function, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{du\left(c_{0}\right)}{dc_{0}}>\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(c_{1}\left(s\right)\right)+\beta u\left(c_{2}\left(s\right)\right)\right)}{ds}
\end{equation}
So the bank can do better by raising period 0 consumption at the expense
of future consumption. The bank limits renegotiation possibilities
by transferring consumption away from the future (when renegotiation
is a temptation) to the present.

To summarize: the requirement that contracts be renegotiation-proof
results in higher period 0 consumption and lower bank profits, and
the denial of service (rationing) of consumers whose smoothing needs
are relatively small.


\subsection{Competition}

As mentioned earlier, under competition, the terms of a renegotiated
contract depend on exclusivity. It follows that a renegotiation-proof
contract under period 1 exclusivity must satisfy $\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{c,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa$
and a renegotiation-proof contract under non-exclusivity must satisfy
$\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{c,m}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa$.
These conditions are equivalent: each states that there is no way
to simultaneously satisfy the consumer's participation constraint
and the bank's '$\kappa$-profit constraint'. So, regardless of exclusivity,
the equilibrium contract under competition is given by:\footnote{A similar analysis could be conducted even if the costs of renegotiating
another bank's contract are different from $\kappa$, the costs of
renegotiating one's own contract.}

\begin{align}
 & \underset{C_{0}}{\mbox{\ensuremath{max}}}U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & \Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)\geq0\label{eq:bpc-rp}\\
 & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{c,r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq\kappa\label{eq:rpc-c}
\end{align}

This yields a contract $C_{0}^{c,rp}$. Given our assumption that
$\kappa<\bar{\kappa}$, the renegotiation-proofness constraint (\ref{eq:rpc-c})
binds at any autarky utility. The properties of the equilibrium contract
are summarized in the next proposition, which is structured like Proposition
2. 
\begin{prop}
(a) At any autarky utility, full commitment is infeasible, so $U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,rp}\right)<U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,fc}\right)$.

(b) If $U_{0}^{A}>\bar{U}$ (as defined in Proposition 2), the period
0 consumer would do worse than in autarky and therefore will not accept
the contract.

(c) The relationship between $c_{0}^{c,rp}$ and $c_{0}^{c,fc}$ is
ambiguous. If $\rho\leq\hat{\rho}$, then $c_{0}^{c,rp}>c_{0}^{c,fc}$.
If $\rho>\hat{\rho}$, then there are parameter values under which
$c_{0}^{c,rp}<c_{0}^{c,fc}$. 
\end{prop}
The first two parts of the proposition are intuitively similar to
the case of monopoly. First, the additional constraint results in
a contract that cannot deliver the optimal utility to the period 0
consumer. Second, if the consumer's autarky utility is high, there
cannot be renegotiation-proof contracts in equilibrium since the consumer
could do better on her own. In fact, the cutoff autarky utility above
which contracts are not offered is the same as under monopoly\textendash this
is the parameter region where it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy
the consumer's participation constraint and the banks' zero-profit
constraint.

Part (c) is a deviation from the results under monopoly. Under competition,
we find that period 0 consumption under renegotiation-proof contracts
may be bigger or smaller than under full-commitment. Again, we provide
the intuition here (the actual proof involves a few additional steps).
The competitive full-commitment contract must satisfy: $\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{c,fc}\right)}{dc_{0}}=\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(\frac{s^{c,fc}}{2}\right)+\beta u\left(\frac{s^{c,fc}}{2}\right)\right)}{ds}$.
If the renegotiation-proof contract were to have the same $c_{0}$,
it must also have the same $s$ (to continue satisfying the zero-profit
constraint), but consumption will be split in period 1's favor. So,
the marginal utility of future consumption becomes: $\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(c_{1}\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)+\beta u\left(c_{2}\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)\right)}{ds}$.
If the utility function is relatively linear (low $\rho$), then an
imbalanced split of $s$ results in a lower marginal utility than
from a balanced split. So: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(c_{1}\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)+\beta u\left(c_{2}\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)\right)}{ds}<\frac{d\left(\beta u\left(\frac{s^{c,fc}}{2}\right)+\beta u\left(\frac{s^{c,fc}}{2}\right)\right)}{ds}=\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{c,fc}\right)}{dc_{0}}
\end{equation}
In such a case, the renegotiation-proof contract must involve higher
period 0 consumption than the full-commitment contract. If, on the
other hand, the utility function is highly convex (high $\rho$),
then an imbalanced split has a higher marginal utility, so the renegotiation-proof
contract will have lower period 0 consumption than under full-commitment.\footnote{The actual argument, in the appendix, is a little more complicated
since we must consider the effect of a change in $s$ not just on
utilities, but also on the relative ratios of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. } This can be seen more explicitly in the clase of $\kappa=0$ (Equation
\ref{eq:zerokappa-comp}).

So, under competition, the renegotiation-proofness constraint could
change the contract in either direction: a larger loan (less saved)
or a smaller loan (more saved). The key reason that the latter possibility
does not exist under monopoly is the following: under monopoly, a
switch from full-commitment to renegotiation-proofness while maintaining
the same $c_{0}$ would require such a large jump in future total
consumption (to maintain the same discounted utility under imbalanced
consumption) that the marginal utility would necessarily fall. The
contrast between monopoly and competition can also be explained using
the intuition of income and substitution effects. Under monopoly,
since the consumer is always left at her autarky utility, there are
no income effects. When the renegotiation-proofness constraint binds,
the price of future utility effectively rises, as a result of which
substitution effects lead to greater period 0 consumption. Under competition,
income and substitution effects counter each other; the net result
depends on the consumer's coefficient of relative risk aversion ($\rho$).

Period 2 consumption however always falls relative to the full commitment
case, even in the cases when Zero acts saves more/borrows less. In
fact for CRRA utility the adjustment of period 0 consumption (in the
absence of commitment compared to with commitment) is always relatively
small while the adjustment to period 1 and period 2 consumption is
relatively much larger.\footnote{To illustrate, with $\kappa-0$ at no point does period 0 consumption
rise or fall by more than six percent for any value $\rho\in(0,\infty)$
and $\beta\in(0,1)$ but at reasonable parameter values such as $\rho=0.5$
and $\beta=0.5$ in the absence of commitment period 1 consumption
rises to 149 percent of the level it would be with commitment, and
period 2 consumption falls to just 37 percent of what it would be.} In other words despite having a first-mover advantage, Zero can do
little much other than to partially accommodate to the consumption
pattern that One self wants to impose.


\subsection{Contracting with Naive Hyperbolic Discounters}

For naive agents, the problem of renegotiation does not lead to a
renegotiation-proof contract. The naif believes she will not be tempted
to renegotiate. Banks therefore offer contracts that take into account
the potential renegotiation. Under monopoly, the bank adds to its
profits by engaging in renegotiation that was not anticipated by the
consumer in period 0. Under competition, banks return the potential
surplus from renegotiation to the period 0 consumer.\footnote{A similar analysis could be carried out if consumers were misinformed
not about their own preferences but about $\kappa$.}


\subsubsection{Monopoly}

Relative to a sophisticated consumer, with a naive consumer the monopolist
bank can make additional profits on two margins. First, since there
is no perceived renegotiation problem, the consumer is willing to
accept a contract that is more profitable for the bank up-front; subsequently,
renegotiation generates additional profits for the bank. Notice that,
unlike with sophisticates, service is not denied to any naif since
the consumer would, at the very least, be willing to accept the full-commitment
contract (since she would not anticipate renegotiation).

With a naive hyperbolic discounter, the bank must choose between a
renegotiation-proof contract and one that will be renegotiated upon.
If the consumer's autarky utility is very low, then the initial contract
can extract so much surplus that there is little to gain from renegotiation.
But when autarky utility is high, the consumer must be offered a contract
with high consumption in each period. It is such consumers, the ones
who have relatively less need for banking, who will find their contracts
renegotiation. In such cases, the bank solves the following problem:\footnote{We do not need to worry about a renegotiation-proofness constraint
here. Since period 0 believes her period 1 preferences are consistent
with her own, she expects any renegotiation of the period 0 contract
to yield the same discounted utility as the contract itself.}
\begin{eqnarray}
\underset{C_{0}}{max} & \Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)+\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)-\kappa\nonumber \\
s.t. & U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\geq U_{0}^{A}\label{eq:pc-n}
\end{eqnarray}


Let the solution be denoted $C_{0}^{m,n}$ (the superscript is for
`monopoly, naive'). This is explicitly derived in the appendix (\ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract1},
\ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract2}). The bank maximizes profits
by offering a contract that divides future consumption as much in
favor of period 2 as possible. We show that if $\rho<1$, the contract
is at a corner solution where $c_{1}=0$. If $\rho>1$, an explicit
solution does not exist, but maximization pushes the contract to a
point where $c_{2}$ approaches infinity.\footnote{This can be dealt with by a reasonable assumption of an upper bound
on contract terms.} In each case, the greater the imbalance between the contracted $c_{1}$
and $c_{2}$, the greater the bank's profits from renegotiation.

This contract can be compared to the full-commitment contract and
to the renegotiation-proof contract for sophisticates. In particular,
it will involve lower period 0 consumption than under full-commitment
or renegotiation-proofness. This result appears counter-intuitive.
In the case of lending, it does not reinforce the narrative of banks
preying on naive consumers by offering them relatively large loans
with steep repayments. Indeed, there are other considerations beyond
the scope of this model, such as the possibility of collateral seizure,
that could generate large loans. But our limited model helps to highlight
a particular aspect of contracting with naive hyperbolic discounters:
here, the bank offers them relatively \emph{small} loans because its
gains from renegotiation depend on the surplus that the initial contract
delivers to periods 1 and 2. In order to fully take advantage of the
consumer's naivete, the consumer must start out with sufficiently
small repayments that the bank could profit from rearranging them.

The next proposition summarizes the above discussion.
\begin{prop}
(a) A monopoly contract will be accepted at any autarky utility. 

(b) There is some $U^{n}<U^{m}$ ($U^{m}$ as defined in Proposition
1) such that, if $U_{0}^{A}\leq U^{n}$, the naive agent will receive
the monopoly full commitment contract and it will not be renegotiated. 

(c) If $U_{0}^{A}>U^{n}$, the monopoly contract will satisfy $c_{0}^{m,n}<c_{0}^{m,fc}<c_{0}^{m,rp}$
(either explicitly or in the limit), and will be renegotiated in period
1.
\end{prop}

\subsubsection{Competition}

Under competition too, contracts will be renegotiated and firms must
account for renegotiation. First, note that if contracts are not exclusive,
the equilibrium contract must be identical to the full-commitment
contract. This is because the firm offering the contract in period
0 does not expect to benefit from renegotiation.

Under exclusive contracts, anticipated profits from future renegotiation
will be returned to the consumer through more favorable initial contracts.
The equilibrium contract satisfies:
\begin{align}
 & \underset{C_{0}}{\mbox{\ensuremath{max}}}U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & \Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)+\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\geq\kappa
\end{align}


Let the solution be denoted $C^{c,n}$ (`competition, naive'). As
under monopoly, first-order conditions lead to a corner solution where
contracts favor period 2 relative to period 1. This maximizes the
potential gains from renegotiation. 

Unlike under monopoly, these anticipated gains must be returned to
the consumer. Some of these gains are returned to period 0, so there
is no clear prediction about whether period 0 consumption will be
lower or higher than under full commitment. This is formalized in
Proposition 5.
\begin{prop}
(a) The competitive contract will be accepted at any autarky utility
and will be renegotiated in period 1.

(b) The non-exclusive competitive contract will be identical to the
full-commitment contract, $c_{0}^{c,fc}$.

(c) Under exclusive contracts, the relationship between $c_{0}^{c,n}$
and $c_{0}^{c,fc}$ is ambiguous. If $\rho<1$, $c_{0}^{c,n}<c_{0}^{c,fc}$.
If $\rho>1$, then there are parameter values under which $c_{0}^{c,n}>c_{0}^{c,fc}$.
\end{prop}

\section{Nonprofits}

Suppose a firm has the possibility of operating as a legal non-profit. Narrowly
stated, non-profit status means that the firm cannot tie managers'
compensation or outside shareholders dividends to firm profits because,
technically speaking, a non-profit firm has no shareholders. As described
in the introduction we prefer a more elastic and encompassing definition
of the non-profit term to include firms that may have shareholders
but who have adopted ownership or governance structures that place
credible and visible constraints on the distribution of profits to managers or investor shareholders. The principals of
such firms may also directly care about social objectives such as the welfare
of their customers, and not just about profits. This broader
interpretation allows the non-profit firm category to include cooperatives
as well as social enterprises and 'hybrid' firms which might be incorporated
as for-profit firms but are owned and controlled by social investors.\footnote{For example, most of the commercial firms that one finds in modern
microfinance (including poster-child firms of he 'commercialization'
revolution in microfinance including Bancosol of Bolivia or Compartamos
of Mexico) are incorporated as for-profit corporations but on close
inspection turn out to be majority-owned and controlled by 'social
investors' that are themselves non-profit foundations.}

To model these ideas in a simple yet still rich manner, assume that
we can classify a firms' nonprofit orientation by a simple parameter
$\alpha\epsilon(0,1]$, which can be viewed as the degree of 'non-profitness'.
A lower $\alpha$ indicates a firm that because of its ownership and
governance structure places the welfare of its clients ahead of that
of its 'owners' and makes the capture of profits by principals (managers,
outside investors) more difficult.

Parameter $\alpha$ affects the firm's maximization problem in two ways. First,
it reduces the firm's ability to capture its raw profits, so that
if a firm produces profits $\Pi$, its principals only get to capure and enjoy  $\alpha\Pi$. \citet{glaeser_not-for-profit_2001} adopt
this approach and suggest that it captures the idea of how the principals
of a nonprofit, though legally barred from paying themselves cash
profits, might capture profits imperfectly via the consumption of
perquisites or 'dividends in kind.' Second, $\alpha$ possibly alters
the renegotiation costs that the firm will incur when it breaks its
promises to customers (e.g. shame, regret, loss of social reputation).
We now label this cost of renegotiation as $\eta(\alpha)$, and assume $\eta$ falls weakly in $\alpha$. In other words more profit-oriented firms feel lower non-pecuniary costs to renegotiating earlier commitments. 

Our analysis below focuses on firm principals that are purely self-interested.
We derive conditions under which the pursuit of profits leads a firm
to voluntarily switch to a form of governance with $\alpha<1$. 

Our new assumptions lead to a modified no-renegotiation constraint \ref{eq:no_reneg}.
This new constraint states that the value of captured profits from not renegotiating
the contract should exceed captured profits from renegotiation net
of renegotiation costs. 
\begin{equation*}
\alpha\Pi_{1}(C_{1}^{r}(C_{1});C_{1})\leq\eta(\alpha)
\end{equation}
 Notice that if we define $\kappa(\alpha)\equiv\frac{\eta(\alpha)}{\alpha}$,
we can rewrite the no-renegotiation constraint as

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}(C_{1}^{r}(C_{1});C_{1})\leq \kappa(\alpha)
\end{equation}

This makes the no-renegotiation constraint look just like the earlier
constraint (\ref{eq:rpc-m}) except that $\kappa$ is now a function
of $\alpha$. Indeed the earlier analyzed  renegotiation
problems just become a special case with $\alpha=1$.


Before proceeding, it should be noted that firms never have an incentive
to switch to nonprofit status when consumers are naive. Since the
consumer does not perceive a need for commitment, the nonprofit's
promise of superior commitment is of no value to her.


\subsection{Monopoly}

In a pre-contract phase the firm now first establishes its type $\alpha$ via the adoption of legal
non-profit status and/or by choosing credible and stable ownership
and governance structures that commit it to those limitations. When
facing a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter, a monopoly firm of type
$\alpha$ designs a renegotiation-proof contract to solve
\begin{align}
 & \underset{C_{0}}{max}\text{  }\alpha\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
 & U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\geq U_{0}^{A}\\
 & \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)\leq \kappa\left(\alpha\right)
\end{align}

Why might a profit-maximizing firm choose to operate as a nonprofit
when that reduces its ability to capture profits? The answer lies
in the loosening of the no-renegotiation constraint. Because the non-profit
can more credibly commit to not renegotiate contracts that offer greater
consumption smoothing in periods 1 and 2, period 0 becomes more willing
to pay for this smoothing service.

The captured-profits maximizing solution gives a contract $C_{0}^{m,np}$
(`monopoly, non-profit'). The no-renegotiation constraint is now relaxed
compared to the earlier pure for-profit case. With a relaxed renegotiation-proof
constraint $\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,np};Y)>\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y)$ but
whether or not it will be in the bank principals' best interest to
strategically convert to non-profit status depends on whether the
profits they can capture under non-profit status exceed the profits
they could earn as a pure for-profit, in other words on whether $\alpha\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,np};Y)\geq\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y)$.
The monopolist faces a tradeoff in considering non-profit status:
higher raw profits (as the commitment problem is partly solved) but
a diminished capture of those raw profits.

Proposition 6 describes conditions under which a firm will operate
as a non-profit. Since the for-profit firm's no-renegotiation constraint
binds, the nonprofit can offer greater commitment and thereby extract
greater surplus from the consumer through the contract signed in period
0. The question is: does the rise in extracted surplus outweigh the
fact that all profits are now discounted? To the extent that the loosening
of the no-renegotiation constraint happens through the right-hand
side (i.e. via term $\eta\left(\alpha\right)$, which represents the
firm's motivation to honor the initial agreement), the firm benefits
unambiguously--it is able to offer better commitment \emph{and} fully
retain the added profits.

If the right-hand side of the no-renegotiation constraint remains
unchanged (as in the proposition), the firm is forced to address the
tradeoff--a lower $\alpha$ means both better commitment and reduced
ability to capture profits. 

If the consumer's autarky consumption bundle is sufficiently close
to optimal to start with then even a nonprofit may be unable to offer
sufficiently smoother consumption that allows it to cover costs. For
intermediate levels of autarky utility, the nonprofit is able to more
credibly promise it will not renegotiate, so it earns positive profits
where the pure for-profit would have earned small or negative profits.
Here, the gains that can be captured from nonprofit status are large
relative to the profits that a for-profit would have made, so the
firm prefers to operate as a nonprofit. As an example, consider an
autarky consumption bundle at which the for-profit firm would earn
zero profits. Now, the nonprofit firm can earn positive profits, so
regardless of $\alpha$ nonprofit status dominates.

Finally, for autarky bundles far from the optimal, the for-profit
firm would anyway be making substantial profits. In this case, the
nonprofit's credibility advantages are not enough to outweigh the
fact that it loses a significant amount of enjoyment of its profits
due to legal restrictions.
\begin{prop}
Consider any $\bar{\alpha}<1$ and a corresponding $\eta\left(\bar{\alpha}\right)=\kappa$.
There is some $\underline{U}^{np}\epsilon\left(U^{m},\bar{U}\right)$
and $\bar{U}^{np}\epsilon(\bar{U},U_{0}^{*}]$ such that, if $U_{0}^{A}\epsilon\left(\underline{U}^{np},\bar{U}^{np}\right)$,
the bank strictly prefers $\alpha=\bar{\alpha}$ over $\alpha=1$.
\end{prop}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_nonprofits.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:nonprofit}Choice of non-profit status and initial endowment
income}
\end{figure}


In Figure \ref{fig:nonprofit} we illustrate the case where non-pecuniary
costs to breaking a promise not to renegotiate fall with $\alpha$
according to $\eta(\alpha)=10(1-\alpha)$ and hence that the overall
cost to renegotiation varies with $\alpha$ according to $\kappa(\alpha)=10(1-\alpha)/\alpha$.
The plots depict captured profits that would be achieved at different
levels $\alpha$ starting from three different initial endowment streams.
These three streams - (60, 120, 120), (90, 105, 105) and (120, 90,
90) -- are equal in their present value of 300 but differ in terms
of period 0 income (with remaining income allocated equally across
period 1 and 2). The higher of the two curved lines represents `raw'
profits $\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,\alpha};Y)$ and the lower curve captured
profits $\alpha\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,\alpha};Y)$. A horizontal line has
been drawn in to indicate the level of profits $\Pi_{0}(C_{0}^{m,1};Y)$
captured by a pure for-profit ($\alpha=1$). Consider the top panel
where the customer has initial income $(60,120,120)$. As this type
of customer wants to borrow heavily in period 0 profits to the bank
are large, even in the case of renegotiation proof contracts. Adopting
non-profit status by lowering $\alpha$ confers no profit gain however:
the cost of lowering alpha (giving up a share of already high profits)
is not compensated for by the gains from being able to credibly commit
to a smoother contract. However at $(90,105,105)$ the tradeoff is
different and profits can be increased. In the picture any non-profit
with an $\alpha$ between approximately 0.7 and less than one captures
more profits than a pure for-profit. Finally for customers with an
endowment $(120,90,90)$ are already fairly close to their preferred
consumption stream so the profits to be captured even under full commitment
are not that large. Indeed in this case a pure for-profit cannot earn
positive profits. Here the cost of adopting non-profit status is low
compared to the gains, and we the simulation reveal that any non-profit
status firm captures more profits than a pure for-profit, and maximum
captured profits are achieved at around $\alpha=0.7$.

We conclude this section with a note on the nature of profit-capture
restrictions faced by a nonprofit. Our assumption that the firm can
capture a fixed fraction of raw profits was useful for exposition
but is perhaps not realistic, and is not necessary for our results.
We might imagine that, at low levels of profits, the nonprofit can
capture most of the profits, and that as profits rise so do the restrictions
on the firm's ability to capture them. In other words, a nonprofit
captures $f\left(\Pi\right)$ of profits, where $f\left(0\right)=0$,
$0<f'\left(\Pi\right)<1$, and $f''\left(\Pi\right)<0.$ In such cases,
we can again clearly see how non-profit status could be attractive
to the firm: the concavity of $f$ can leave the enjoyment of profits
relatively unaffected while significantly loosening the no-renegotiation
constraint (since renegotiation would raise profits further, and since
$f$ is concave, these additional profits would count for little).


\subsection{Competition}


\subsubsection{Exclusive contracts}

Consider what would happen in the competitive market situation now
if contracts can be assumed to remain exclusive, so that any new surplus
in the event of a renegotiation between the bank and the period 1
self goes to the bank (this grants the bank monopoly power in period
1). A firm of type $\alpha$ will be led to offer contract terms to
solve
\begin{align}
\underset{C_{0}}{max} & U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\nonumber \\
s.t. & \alpha\Pi_{0}(C_{0};Y_{0})\geq0\\
 & \Pi_{0}(C_{1}^{r}(C_{1});C_{1})\leq\kappa(\alpha)
\end{align}


Here, as before, $\kappa(\alpha)=\frac{\eta(\alpha)}{\alpha}$, captures
the idea that the principals of a firm that adopts non-profit status
commit themselves to capturing a smaller share of raw profits and
may also suffer greater direct disutility from breaking promises to
customers. Let the contract that solves this program be denoted $C_{0}^{c,e,np}$
(`competition, exclusive, nonprofit').

Consider first a field where all firms start as pure for-profits ($\alpha=1$).
If the no-renegotiation constraint binds, consumer welfare must be
lower than that when the firms can commit to not renegotiate since
an additional constraint is imposed. Starting from this situation
consider now one firm's strategic choice of whether to adopt non-profit
status (i.e. to change its ownership and governance structures to
an $\alpha=\bar{\alpha}<1$ relaxing the no-renegotiation constraint.
One firm deviating into nonprofit status in this way can make positive
profits. So, if the borrowers are sophisticated hyperbolics, in equilibrium
all firms become nonprofit. As proven in the appendix, competition
will ensure however that in equilibrium the principals of all firms
are capturing zero profits.


\subsubsection{Non-Exclusive Contracts}

In the previous section, we had a setting with competition in period
0 but exclusive contracting and monopoly power in period 1. Now, assume
that exclusivity and period 1 monopoly power disappears. Firms can
compete to renegotiate each other's contracts in period 1. 

If there were only nonprofits in equilibrium, any one firm could make
positive profits by switching to for-profit status and undoing a rival
bank's contract in period 1. The advantages of undercutting other
firms' contracts outweigh the benefits of promising one's own clients
it will not renegotiate. As a result, equilibrium contracts will be
determined by for-profit firms, and consumers will be offered lower
commitment than from non-profit firms alone.\footnote{The same argument applies if banks can costlessly renegotiate other
bank's contracts.}
\begin{prop}
Consider any $\bar{\alpha}<1$ and a corresponding $\eta\left(\bar{\alpha}\right)=\kappa$.

(a) In a competitive banking market with exclusive contracts, all
active firms will be nonprofits (contracts will be offered for $U_{0}^{A}\leq\bar{U}^{np}$,
with $\bar{U}^{np}>\bar{U}$ as defined in Proposition 6).

(b) In a competitive banking market with non-exclusive contracts,
for-profits must exist in equilibrium (contracts will be offered for
$U_{0}^{A}\leq\bar{U}$, with $\bar{U}$ as defined in Proposition
2).
\end{prop}

\section{Discussion and Extensions}



The model above formalizes the renegotiation problem faced by banks
that contract with hyperbolic discounters, and shows how the problem
is addressed in equilibrium contracts. Figure \ref{fig:Summary} summarizes
the key results of Sections 4-6. We show how contracts depend on relative
distances from the optimal autarky utility, $U_{0}^{*}$. The results,
taken together, generate some natural yet novel empirical predictions
that are in principle testable. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{fig_results}

\caption{\label{fig:Summary}Summary of results}
\end{figure}


We first discuss naive hyperbolic discounters. Under monopoly, contracts
will be subject to renegotiation if the consumer is close enough to
optimal autarky; if not, the full-commitment contract leaves the consumer
with so little consumption that there is no point renegotiating. The
parameter region in which contracts are renegotiated is relatively
large, and even includes cases where the sophisticate would be offered
a full-commitment contract. The renegotiable contract involves less
period-0 consumption that the full-commitment contract as this allows
the bank to exploit renegotiation possibilities most comprehensively.

Under competition, any contract will be renegotiated, even for consumers
whose autarky outcomes are very poor. This is because competitive
full-commitment contracts always leave consumers with relatively high
levels of future consumption. The implications for contract terms
are ambiguous.

Next, we turn to sophisticated hyperbolic discounters under monopoly.
If the consumer's smoothing needs are large (i.e. autarky utility
is low), full-commitment is feasible since the contract terms leave
little that is susceptible to renegotiation. If smoothing needs are
moderate, the consumer is offered a renegotiation-proof contract which
has a larger period-0 consumption than the full-commitment contract
(this serves to reduce the contract's susceptibility to renegotiation).
If smoothing needs are small, the consumer is better off in autarky
than in any contract that satisfies the renegotiation-proof constraint.
As a result of the problem of renegotiation, such consumers will not
be offered contracts.

Under competition, sophisticates will not be offered full-commitment
contracts. Since full-commitment would entail high consumption levels
in periods 1 and 2 regardless of autarky utility, the renegotiation-proofness
constraint must always bind. As under naivete, the implications for
contract terms are ambiguous.

Finally, we derive conditions under which banks will operate as nonprofits.
A monopoly will switch to a nonprofit if, as a for-profit its profits
were close to zero (above or below). In these cases, the bank is willing
to forgo some enjoyment of its profits in exchange for a loosened
renegotiation-proofness constraint. So, nonprofits will be able to
serve some consumers relatively closer to optimal autarky utility,
ones who would be unbanked under for-profit monopoly.

Under competition, banks should operate as nonprofits if contracts
are exclusive, as they can capture the surplus from improved contracts
possible under nonprofit status. If contracts are non-exclusive, no
bank can benefit from operating as a nonprofit, and for-profit banks
prevail.


\subsection{Additional Considerations}

Our model delivers predictions about how renegotiation concerns affect
commitment contracts, and about parameter regions in which these concerns
actually matter. In particular, we generate comparative statics over
autarky utilities. Autarky utility is not informative in isolation,
but in conjunction with total income serves as an indicator of the
extent of smoothing that remains to be provided by a bank. As we show,
contract terms depend in particular ways at different degrees of smoothing
needs.

The sizes of relevant parameter regions discussed above will vary
according to other parameter values such as the cost of renegotiation,
$\kappa$, and total income, $y$. For example, as $\kappa$ rises
there will be an expansion of the parameter region in which full commitment
survives. On the other hand, as $y$ rises, commitment in general
will be harder to sustain since contracts terms must allow for higher
consumption in periods 1 and 2.

While the focus of our paper is on contracts, a few observations on
welfare can be made. Under hyperbolic discounting, there is no obvious
notion of welfare, and for our purpose we take it to the discounted
utility of the period 0 self. Clearly, for sophisticated hyperbolic
discounters under monopoly, welfare remains constant regardless of
renegotiation concerns and bank governance--the consumer is always
left with autarky utility. Under competition, welfare is lower under
renegotiation-proof contracts relative to full-commitment (when the
constraint binds), and nonprofits serve to raise welfare.

\subsubsection{Equilibria allowing period 1 contracts}

Our preceding analysis made the simplifying assumption that contracts
between consumers and banks could only be initiated in period 0. The alternative to a period
0 contract was autarky for the consumer in the  monopoly case and zero profits for the
bank under competition. This
served to streamline the analysis. We now discuss how the interesting problem of how the contract space is enriched by allowing unbanked consumers
to sign two-period contracts in period 1, possibly without contracting in period 0.\footnote{We thank Abhijit Banerjee for very helpful discussions about this point.} The main change will relate to the formulation of reservation values and
their implications for the shape and feasibility of the period 0 contracts.  The main qualitative results of the paper go through but the discussion raises interesting questions about circumstances where consumers could be better off under an autarky economy compared  to one with a financial intermediary. 

Consider the monopolist bank facing a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter.
If a contract were not signed in period 0, they would meet again in
period 1. In period 1, the contract must satisfy the One-self's participation
constraint, which would be determined by some unbanked consumption
path $C_{1}^{A'}$. This can be stated formally. Given some autarky
consumption path $C_{1}^{A'}$, the bank solves:
\begin{align*}
\underset{C_{1}}\max  \text{ }{ \Pi_{1}\left(C_{1};C_{1}^{A'}\right)}\\
\text{s.t.  }  U_{1}\left(C_{1}\right)\geq U_{1}\left(C_{1}^{A'}\right)
\end{align*}

Let the solution be denoted $C_{1}^{m1}$. Two observations can be
made. First, the bank can always offer a period 1 contract that delivers
nonnegative profits. This is because any contract will satisfy One-self's
optimality condition, $u'\left(c_{1}^{m1}\right)=\beta u'\left(c_{2}^{m1}\right)$.
So, except in the special case where the autarky consumption path
satisfies this condition, the bank can make positive profits in period
1. Second, the autarky consumption path $C_{1}^{A'}$ might differ
from $C_{1}^{A}$, the consumer's autarky utility in the absence of
banking. In other words, $C_{1}^{A}$ maximizes $U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{A}\right)$
while $C_{1}^{A'}$ maximizes $U_{0}\left(c_{0}^{A'},c_{1}^{m1},c_{2}^{m2}\right)$.
In the latter case, period 0 anticipates that consumption across periods
1 and 2 is guaranteed to satisfy period 1's optimality condition.
We can denote $C_{0}^{B}\equiv\left(c_{0}^{A'},c_{1}^{m1},c_{2}^{m2}\right)$,
which corresponds to a Zero-self utility of $U_{0}^{B}$.

In period 0, any contract must meet the Zero-self's reservation utility,
$U_{0}^{B}$:
\begin{align*}
\underset{C_{0}}{max} & \Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)\\
\text{s.t.} & \text{\ensuremath{U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)\geq U_{0}^{B}}}
\end{align*}

The maximization problem looks familiar, apart from the modified reservation
utility. The Zero-self's discounted utility from such a contract is
no longer monotonic in her full autarky utility, $U_{0}^{A}$. For
example, consider two hypothetical consumers who in autarky must consume
their income streams, which deliver the same autarky utility but through
different consumption paths: consumer X has $c_{1}^{A}=c_{2}^{A}$
while consumer Y has $c_{1}^{A}>c_{2}^{A}$ in a way that satisfies
period 1's optimality condition. Then, for consumer X, $U_{0}^{B}<U_{0}^{A}$
while for consumer Y, $U_{0}^{B}=U_{0}^{A}$. It follows that, since
period 0 contracts depend on the distribution of future consumption,
a consumer who fares relatively better in the absence of a bank may
fare relatively worse under a banking contract.

Given this benchmark full-commitment contract, the renegotiation-proof
contract can be solved for by adding a no-renegotiation constraint
to the above maximization problem. The constraint is the same as used
previously, and again narrows the set of contracts that can be offered
in period 0. As in Proposition 2 (parts a and c), the renegotiation-proof
constraint results in lower profits and greater period 0 consumption
relative to full-commitment. These results are independent of the
period 0 reservation utility and therefore remain unchanged.

A key difference here, however, is that a renegotiation-proof contract
will be offered to all consumers (unlike before, where the bank was
better off not contracting with consumers whose autarky utility left
them close enough to the first-best). Intuitively, this is because
the alternative to a period 0 contract is not autarky; rather, it
is a period 1 contract that tilts consumption in period 1's favor.
Since, in period 0, the bank can at least offer the consumer a consumption
path of $C_{0}^{B}$, it ensures that a contract will be accepted.

By opening up the possibility of period 1 contracts, we introduce
an additional consideration\textendash the bank that offers commitment
itself creates a need for it. By threatening to fully indulge the
One-self's preferences, the bank is always able to induce the Zero-self
to accept an offer of partial commitment, no matter how weak.

Finally, observe that the bank's decision about whether to operate
as a nonprofit is subject to the same tradeoff between improved commitment
and reduced enjoyment of profits. However, the attractiveness of nonprofit
status drops (relative to the case where period 1 contracts are disallowed)
due to the fact that even the for-profit bank finds it profitable
to offer contracts to consumers at all levels of autarky utility.

Next, we turn to competition. In most cases, the possibility of period
1 contracts leaves our previous analysis unaltered. This is because
competitive contracts do not depend on autarky utility. The only modification
to our previous results relates to Proposition 3 (part b). Now, the
consumer will accept a period 0 renegotiation-proof contract at any
autarky utility since not doing so exposes her to a period 1 contract
that fully satisfies period 1's taste for imbalanced consumption.
\section{Conclusion}

The starting point for this paper is the observation that the solution
to any commitment problem must also address a renegotiation problem.
We show how the renegotiation problem affects different types of consumers
and how it changes contract terms in sometimes unexpected ways. In
this context, we also provide a rationalization of commercial nonprofits
in the absence of asymmetric information.

We argue that the model sheds some light on trends in microfinance,
payday lending, and mortgage lending. We hope this paper also offers
a framework that can be built upon. The incorporation of additional
`real-world' factors could improve our understanding of particular
institutions and generate empirically relevant comparative statics.
Examples of these include nondeterministic incomes, private and heterogenous
types, collateral and strategic default, and longer time horizons.

Finally, the differences between monopoly and competition open up
some new, potentially interesting questions. How does market structure
evolve and what are the implications for commitment? And through this
evolution might there emerge third parties to contracts between consumers
and banks that can more effectively enforce the commitment that is
sought after on both sides of the market?

\section{Appendix: CRRA Derivations and Proofs}


\subsection{Full-Commitment}

For the monopolist bank that offers full-commitment, the solution
is determined by the first-order condition and the consumer's participation
constraint:
\begin{align}
C_{0}^{mF} & =\left(1,\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)
\cdot \left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{1+2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)
^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}} \label{eq:c-mf} \\ 
\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{mF};Y_{0}\right) & 
=y-\left(U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}
\left(1+2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\label{eq:pi-mf}
\end{align}


For the competitive banks that offer full-commitment, the solutions
is determined by the first-order condition and the bank's participation
constraint:
\begin{equation}
C_{0}^{F}=\left(1,\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{y}{1+2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)\label{eq:c-cf}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Renegotiation}

Given an existing contract $C_{1}$, a monopolist bank that renegotiates
in period 1 will offer the following new contract:
\begin{equation}
C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right)=\left(1,\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)\label{eq:c-r}
\cdot \left(\frac{c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}
\end{equation}


The corresponding profit gains from renegotiation are:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)=\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\right)-\left(c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\label{eq:pi-r}
\end{equation}


An alternate way to restate the above is the following: Let $s$ and
$\alpha$ be defined such that $c_{1}=\alpha s$ and $c_{2}=\left(1-\alpha\right)s$.
Then:
\begin{equation}
C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right)=\left(s,s\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)\label{eq:c-r-alpha}
\cdot \left(\frac{\alpha^{1-\rho}+\beta\left(1-\alpha\right)^{1-\rho}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}
\end{equation}


Profit gains from renegotiation become:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right);C_{1}\right)=\left(s\right)\left(1-\left(\alpha^{1-\rho}+\beta\left(1-\alpha\right)^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\right)\label{eq:renegotiation-profits}
\end{equation}


By construction, profits from renegotiation are strictly positive
(and increasing in $s$), except in the special case where $C_{1}$
is optimal from period 1's perspective ($\left(1-\alpha\right)=\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\alpha$),
in which case they are $0$. It can also easily be confirmed that
profits from renegotiation fall in $\alpha$ as long as the allocation
is such that period 1 would like a larger $\alpha$ than the current
contract offers.

\textbf{\textit{Proof of Proposition 1:}} (a) In any full-commitment
contract, $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$. Inserting this into (\ref{eq:renegotiation-profits}),
the following must be satisfied for a full-commitment contract to
survive:
\begin{equation}
k\geq s\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\beta\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\right)\label{eq:max-kappa-part}
\end{equation}
Substituting for $s$ from the competitive full-commitment contract,
we can rewrite the above condition as:
\begin{equation}
k\geq\frac{2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}y}{1+2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\beta\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\right)\equiv\bar{\kappa}\label{eq:max-kappa}
\end{equation}
Since in any full-commitment contract (monopoly and competition),
$s$ will be no larger than $\frac{2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}y}{1+2\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}$,
no full-commitment contract will be renegotiated if $\kappa\geq\bar{\kappa}$.

(c) If $\kappa<\bar{\kappa}$, condition \ref{eq:max-kappa} fails,
so the competitive full-commitment contract cannot survive. 

(b) The monopolist full-commitment contract will not survive if $s$
is sufficiently large. Since $s^{m,fc}$ is exponentially increasing
in $U_{0}^{A}$, there must be some $U^{m}$ such that the contract
will not survive if and only if $U_{0}^{A}>U^{m}$. Since the contract
cannot survive at $U_{0}^{*}$ (here, the contract is identical to
the competitive contract) , $U^{m}<U_{0}^{*}$. $\Square$


\subsection{Renegotiation-Proof Contracts}


\subsubsection{Sophisticated Hyperbolic Discounters}

When the renegotiation-proofness constraint binds, consumption in
periods 1 and 2 must satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\left(s\right)\left(1-\left(\alpha^{1-\rho}-\beta\left(1-\alpha\right)^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\right)=\kappa\label{eq:rp-constraint}
\end{equation}


For any $s$, there may be two values of $\alpha$ that satisfy the
constraint with equality--one with too little consumption relative
to period 1's optimal, one with too much consumption relative to period
1's optimal. The relevant value for us is the first. This defines
a continuous function $\alpha\left(s\right)$.
\begin{equation}
\alpha\left(s\right)=min\left\{ \alpha:\left(s\right)\left(1-\left(\alpha^{1-\rho}+\beta\left(1-\alpha\right)^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho}}\right)=\kappa\right\} \label{eq:alpha}
\end{equation}


As $s$ rises, to continue satisfying the constraint we must have
$\alpha\left(s\right)$ rising too (if fractions stayed constant,
profits from renegotiation would rise).

We can also rewrite the first-order condition of the bank's maximization
problem using the new notation. For any $s$ and $\alpha$, let $V\left(s,\alpha\right)=u\left(\alpha s\right)+u\left(\left(1-\alpha\right)s\right)$.
This is the discounted utility over periods 1 and 2, from period 0's
perspective. The solution, $C_{0}=$$\left(c_{0},\alpha s,\left(1-\alpha\right)s\right)$,
must satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\frac{du\left(c_{0}\right)}{dc_{0}}=\beta\frac{dV\left(s,\alpha\right)}{ds}\label{eq:du-dv}
\end{equation}


In other words, at the profit-maximizing contract the marginal dollar
should be equally valuable whether consumed immediately or distributed
across future periods.

\textbf{\textit{Proof of Proposition 2:}} (a) Since the profit-maximizing
contract was uniquely determined, and since it does not satisfy the
renegotiation-proofness constraint, the renegotiation-proof contract
must yield lower profits than the full-commitment contract does.

(b) Clearly, $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)$ falls strictly
in $U_{0}^{A}$ (if autarky utility falls, the bank can always do
better, at least by simply lowering $c_{0}$). Since at $U_{0}^{A}=U^{m}$,
$\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)=\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)>0$
and at $U_{0}^{A}=U^{*}$, $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)<\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)=0$,
there must be some intermediate autarky utility above which the bank's
maximized profits will be negative.

(c) consider any $c_{0}\leq c_{0}^{m,fc}$ and $s$ such that $U_{0}\left(c_{0},\frac{s}{2},\frac{s}{2}\right)=U_{0}^{A}$.
We can find the corresponding $\bar{s}$ that, while satisfying the
participation constraint, gives the same utility from period 0's perspective: 

\begin{align}
V\left(s,\frac{1}{2}\right) & =\bar{V}\left(\bar{s},\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)\label{eq:v=00003Dvbar1}\\
\Rightarrow2\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}s\right)^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho} & =\frac{\left(\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}+\frac{\left(\left(1-\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\label{eq:v-vbar2}\\
\Rightarrow\bar{s} & =s\left(\frac{2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1-\rho}}{\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}+\left(1-\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)^{1-\rho}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\label{eq:v-vbar3}
\end{align}


From this, we get the following inequality:
\begin{align}
\frac{dV\left(\bar{s},\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)}{ds} & =\bar{s}^{-\rho}\left(\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}+\left(1-\alpha\left(s\right)\right)^{1-\rho}\right)+\frac{d\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)}{ds}\bar{s}^{1-\rho}\left(\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)^{-\rho}-\left(1-\alpha\right)^{-\rho}\right)\label{eq:dv-ds1}\\
 & <\bar{s}^{-\rho}\left(\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}+\left(1-\alpha\left(s\right)\right)^{1-\rho}\right)\label{eq:dv-ds2}\\
 & =s^{-\rho}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1-\rho}\right)\left(\frac{2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1-\rho}}{\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)^{1-\rho}+\left(1-\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)^{1-\rho}}\right)^{\frac{-1}{1-\rho}}\label{eq:dv-ds3}\\
 & <s^{-\rho}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1-\rho}\right)=\frac{dV\left(s,\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}\label{eq:dv-ds4}
\end{align}


The first line above splits the effect of $s$ on $V$ into two--the
first term represents the change in utility holding $\alpha$ constant,
and the second term represents the (negative) effect of the further
skewing of consumption that results from a rise in $s$. The final
inequality follows from the fact that, since $\bar{s}>s^{m,fc}$,
the renegotiation constraint must bind so that $\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)>\frac{1}{2}$.
Finally, the following inequality holds:
\begin{align}
\frac{du\left(c_{0}\right)}{dc_{0}} & \geq\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{m,fc}\right)}{dc_{0}}=\beta\frac{dV\left(s^{m,fc},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}\label{eq:dudc-dvds1}\\
 & \geq\beta\frac{dV\left(s,\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}>\beta\frac{dV\left(\bar{s},\alpha\left(\bar{s}\right)\right)}{ds}\label{eq:dudc-dvds2}
\end{align}


We have shown that at any $c_{0}\leq c_{0}^{m,fc}$, for a contract
that satisfies the renegotiation-proofness constraint, the marginal
utility of period 0 consumption will be higher than the discounted
marginal utility of future consumption, so the bank could earn strictly
higher profits by raising $c_{0}$ and lowering $s$ further. Therefore,
in the renegotiation-proof contract, $c_{0}^{m,rp}>c_{0}^{m,fc}$.
$\Square$

\textbf{\emph{Proof of Proposition 3:}} (a) We know that $U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,fc}\right)=U_{0}^{*}$.
By assumption, since the renegotiation-proofness constraint is binding,
the renegotiation-proof contract cannot offer the optimal consumption
path. Therefore $U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,rp}\right)<U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,fc}\right)$.

(b) Consider $\bar{U}$, as constructed in Proposition 2. If $U_{0}^{A}>\bar{U}$,
it is impossible to construct a contract that earns nonnegative profits
and gives the consumer at least autarky utility. Therefore, any contract
that earns zero profits would give the period 0 consumer less than
autarky utility. (As an aside, observe that $\bar{U}=U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,rp}\right)$.)

(c) At the full-commitment contract:
\begin{equation}
\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{c,fc}\right)}{dc}=\beta\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}=\left(s^{c,fc}\right)^{-\rho}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{1-\rho}\right)
\end{equation}
Consider a renegotiation-proof contract with $c_{0}=c_{0}^{c,fc}$.
To keep bank profits zero, this contract would also have $s=s^{c,fc}$.
But in the renegotiation-proof contract, $s$ must be divided according
to the fraction $\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)$. So:
\begin{align}
\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)}{ds} & =\left(s^{c,fc}\right)^{-\rho}\left(\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)^{1-\rho}+\left(1-\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)^{1-\rho}\right)\nonumber \\
 & +\frac{d\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)}{ds}\left(s^{c,fc}\right)^{1-\rho}\left(\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)^{-\rho}-\left(1-\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)^{-\rho}\right)\label{eq:dv-ds-comp}
\end{align}
The first term--the direct effect of a change in $s$--is weakly less
than $\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}$ if $\rho\leq1$
and strictly greater if $\rho>1$. The second term--the component
of $\frac{dV}{ds}$ that is driven by the change in $\alpha$--is
strictly negative. Therefore, if $\rho<1$, $\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)}{ds}<\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}=\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{c,fc}\right)}{dc}$,
so the renegotiation-proof contract must satisfy $c_{0}^{c,rp}>c_{0}^{c,fc}$.

Next, we consider the case when $\rho>1$. We can make the following
observations about $\alpha\left(s\right)$. First, $\underset{\kappa\rightarrow0}{lim}\alpha\left(s\right)=\frac{\beta^{\frac{-1}{\rho}}}{1+\beta^{\frac{-1}{\rho}}}$
(this follows from the fact that at $\kappa=0$, the contract must
satisfy $u'\left(c_{1}\right)=\beta u'\left(c_{2}\right)$). Second,
implicitly differentiating equation \ref{eq:alpha} with respect to
$s$, and combining it with the previous limit result, we get $\underset{\kappa\rightarrow0}{lim}\frac{d\alpha\left(s\right)}{ds}=0$.
Therefore, if $\rho>1$ and $\kappa$ is small enough, the second
term in Equation \ref{eq:dv-ds-comp} will be sufficiently small in
magnitude that $\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\alpha\left(s^{c,fc}\right)\right)}{ds}>\frac{dV\left(s^{c,fc},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{ds}=\frac{du\left(c_{0}^{c,fc}\right)}{dc}$.
In this case, the renegotiation-proof contract must satisfy $c_{0}^{c,rp}<c_{0}^{c,fc}$.
$\Square$

If $\kappa=0$, the renegotiation-proof contracts can be explicitly
derived since in any contract it must be true that $c_{2}=\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{1}$.
Solving the respective maximization problems, we get the following
equilibrium contracts for monopoly and competition, respectively:
\begin{align}
C_{0}^{m,rp}= & \left(\left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(\frac{\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1-\rho}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{1-\rho}{\rho}}}\right)}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}},\left(\frac{\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{0}^{m,rp},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(\frac{\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}c_{0}^{m,rp}\right)\label{eq:zerokappa-monop}\\
C_{0}^{c,rp}= & \left(\frac{y}{1+\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}},\left(\frac{\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)c_{0}^{c,rp},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(\frac{\beta+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)c_{0}^{c,rp}\right)\label{eq:zerokappa-comp}
\end{align}


It can easily be established that $c_{0}^{m,rp}>c_{0}^{m,fc}$, $c_{0}^{c,rp}>c_{0}^{m,fc}$
if $\rho>1$, and $c_{0}^{c,rp}<c_{0}^{m,fc}$ if $\rho<1$.


\subsubsection{Naive Hyperbolic Discounters}

Suppose the monopolist intends to renegotiate the contract. The maximization
problem, combined with the expression for $C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}\right)$
(\ref{eq:c-r-alpha}), simplifies to:

\begin{align}
\underset{c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}}{max} & y-c_{0}-\frac{\left(c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}}{\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}}}-\kappa\\
s.t. & \frac{c_{0}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}+\beta\frac{c_{1}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}+\beta\frac{c_{2}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\geq U_{0}^{A}
\end{align}


The partial derivatives of the resulting Lagrangian are:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{0}} & =-1-\lambda c_{0}^{-\rho}\label{eq:L0}\\
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{1}} & =c_{1}^{-\rho}\left[-\left(\frac{c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}}-\lambda\beta\right]\label{eq:L1}\\
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{2}} & =c_{2}^{-\rho}\left[-\beta\left(\frac{c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}}-\lambda\beta\right]\label{eq:L2}
\end{align}


An interior solution, with $\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{1}}=0$
and $\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{2}}=0$ does not exist
since (on a $c_{1}-c_{2}$ plot, the two first-order conditions do
not intersect). If $\rho<1$, the Lagrangian is maximized at a corner
solution with $c_{1}=0$. If $\rho>1$, the Lagrangian is maximized
at the limit as $c_{2}$ approaches infinity. Using this, the maximization
problem can be re-solved. If $\rho<1$:
\begin{equation}
C_{0}^{m,n}=\left(\left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{2+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}},0,\left(\frac{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{\beta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{2+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\right)\label{eq:naive-monopolist-contract1}
\end{equation}
If $\rho>1$, the solution is undefined, but in the limit is given
by:
\begin{equation}
C_{0}^{m,n}=\left(\left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{1+\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(\frac{U_{0}^{A}\left(1-\rho\right)}{1+\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}},\infty\right)\label{eq:naive-monopolist-contract2}
\end{equation}


\textbf{\emph{Proof of Proposition 4:}} (a) At any autarky utility,
the monopolist could at least offer the full-commitment contract.

(b) The bank must choose between a renegotiation-proof contract and
a renegotiable contract (\ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract1}, \ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract2}).
By construction of $U^{m}$, the following must be true at any $U_{0}^{A}\geq U^{m}$:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)\leq\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)\leq\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)+\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}^{m,fc}\right);C_{1}^{m,fc}\right)-\kappa
\end{equation}


Since $C_{0}^{m,n}$ is uniquely determined and $C_{0}^{m,n}\neq C_{0}^{m,fc}$,
profits from the best renegotiable contract must be strictly higher
than profits from the renegotiation-proof contract at any $U_{0}^{A}\geq U^{m}$.

The following can be verified from the explicit derivations of $C_{0}^{m,fc}$
and $C_{0}^{m,n}$. First, if $U_{0}^{A}$ is sufficiently small,
$\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)>\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,n};Y_{0}\right)+\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}^{m,n}\right);C_{1}^{m,n}\right)-\kappa$.
Second,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dU_{0}^{A}}\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,fc};Y_{0}\right)>\frac{d}{dU_{0}^{A}}\left[\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,n};Y_{0}\right)+\Pi_{1}\left(C_{1}^{r}\left(C_{1}^{m,n}\right);C_{1}^{m,n}\right)-\kappa\right]
\end{equation}


It follows that there is some $U^{n}<U^{m}$ such that if $U_{0}^{A}\leq U^{n}$,
the naive agent will receive the monopoly full commitment contract,
which will be renegotiation-proof.

(c) This can be confirmed from the explicit formulations of $C_{0}^{m,fc}$
(\ref{eq:c-mf}) and $C_{0}^{m,n}$ (\ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract1},
\ref{eq:naive-monopolist-contract2}). $\Square$

We now derive equilibrium contracts for naive consumers under perfect
competition. Suppose contracts are exclusive. Then, a contract that
is renegotiated satisfies:
\begin{align}
\underset{c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}}{max} & \frac{c_{0}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}+\beta\frac{c_{1}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}+\beta\frac{c_{2}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\\
s.t. & y-c_{0}-\frac{\left(c_{1}^{1-\rho}+\beta c_{2}^{1-\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}}{\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}}}-\kappa\geq0
\end{align}


The first-order conditions are the same as under monopoly (\ref{eq:L0},
\ref{eq:L1}, \ref{eq:L2}). Combining these with the zero-profit
constraint, we get the following solution. If $\rho<1$:
\begin{equation}
C_{0}^{c,n}=\left(\frac{y-\kappa}{2+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}},0,\left(\frac{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{\beta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(\frac{y-\kappa}{2+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}\right)\right)\label{eq:naive-comp-contract1}
\end{equation}


If $\rho>1$, the solution is undefined, but in the limit is given
by:
\begin{equation}
C_{0}^{c,n}=\left(\frac{y-\kappa}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)},\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}\left(\frac{y-\kappa}{1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\left(1+\beta^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right)}\right),\infty\right)\label{eq:naive-comp-contract2}
\end{equation}


\textbf{\emph{Proof of Proposition 5:}} (a) Banks can at least offer
the consumer the full-commitment contract, so a contract is feasible
at any autarky utility. Since, from the consumer's perspective, any
renegotiation-proof contract is strictly dominated by the full-commitment
contract (which will be renegotiated), in equilibrium she will be
offered a contract that will be renegotiated.

(b) Under non-exclusive contracts, firms offering period 0 contracts
do not benefit from renegotiation (profits from renegotiation will
equal $\kappa$). So the equilibrium contract is identical to the
full-commitment contract.

(c) Suppose $\rho<1$. Comparing $C_{0}^{c,fc}$ (\ref{eq:c-cf})
to $C_{0}^{c,n}$ (\ref{eq:naive-comp-contract1}), it is clear that
$c_{0}^{c,n}<c_{0}^{c,fc}$. Suppose $\rho>1$. If $\kappa$ is small
enough, $c_{0}^{c,n}>c_{0}^{c,fc}$. $\Square$


\subsection{Nonprofits}
\begin{lem}
$\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)$ and $\bar{\alpha}\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0}^{m,np};Y_{0}\right)$
are continuously decreasing in $U_{0}^{A}$.
\end{lem}
\textbf{\emph{Proof of Lemma 1: }}We prove the above for renegotiation-proof
contracts of for-profit banks. The same argument applies to nonprofit
banks. First, it is clear that profits are strictly decreasing in
$U_{0}^{A}$: If autarky utility drops from $U_{0}^{A}=U$ to $\bar{U_{0}^{A}=U}$,
at $\bar{U}$ the bank can always do better than offering the contract
it offered at $U$.

Next, we prove right-continuity at any $U_{0}^{A}=U$. Let the maximized
profits at $U$ be $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)$, where $C_{0}=\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}\right)$.
This contract must satisfy $U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)=U$. For any $\bar{U}>U$,
profits must be lower, and bounded below by $\Pi_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0};Y_{0}\right)$,
with the contract defined as $\bar{C}_{0}=\left(c_{0}+x,c_{1},c_{2}\right)$
where $x$ satisfies $U_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0}\right)=\bar{U}$. Since
$\underset{\bar{U}\rightarrow U^{+}}{lim}\Pi_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0};Y_{0}\right)=\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)$,
the profit function is right-continuous.

Finally, we prove left-continuity at at any $U_{0}^{A}=U$. For any
$\bar{U}<U$, denote maximized profits $\Pi_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0};Y_{0}\right)$,
where $\bar{C}_{0}=\left(\bar{c}_{0},\bar{c}_{1},\bar{c}_{2}\right)$.
These contracts must satisfy $U_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0}\right)=\bar{U}$.
At $U$, profits must be lower, and bounded below by $\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)$,
with the contract defined as $C_{0}=\left(\bar{c}_{0}+x,\bar{c}_{1},\bar{c}_{2}\right)$
where $x$ satisfies $U_{0}\left(C_{0}\right)=U$. Since $\underset{\bar{U}\rightarrow U^{-}}{lim}\Pi_{0}\left(\bar{C}_{0};Y_{0}\right)=\Pi_{0}\left(C_{0};Y_{0}\right)$,
the profit function is left-continuous. $\Square$

\textbf{\emph{Proof of Proposition 6: }}Let $\eta\left(\bar{\alpha}\right)=1$,
to minimize the attractiveness of the nonprofit. Consider $U_{0}^{A}=\bar{U}$.
Since the for-profit's renegotiation-proofness binds and leaves the
firm with zero profits, and since the non-profit's renegotiation-proofness
constraint is looser than the for-profit's, we know that $\bar{\alpha}\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,np};Y_{0}\right)>0=\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,rp};Y_{0}\right)$.
Since profits must be continuously decreasing in $U_{0}^{A}$, and
since $\bar{\alpha}\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,np};Y_{0}\right)<\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,rp},;Y\right)$
at $U_{0}^{A}=U^{m}$ (where the for-profit's renegotiation-proofness
constraint no longer binds) and $\bar{\alpha}\Pi\left(C_{0}^{m,np};Y_{0}\right)\leq0$
at $U_{0}^{A}=U_{0}^{*}$, there must exist autarky utility values
as described in the proposition statement such that, if $U_{0}^{A}>\underline{U}^{np}$
the bank strictly prefers to operate as a nonprofit relative to a
for-profit, and if $U_{0}^{A}\geq\bar{U}^{np}$ it weakly prefers
to not offer a contract. $\Square$

\textbf{\emph{Proof of Proposition 7: }}(a) Suppose all firms are
for-profit. There is some $\varepsilon_{1}$ and $\varepsilon_{2}$
satisfying $0<\varepsilon_{2}<\varepsilon_{1}$ and a corresponding
$\hat{C}_{0}=\left(c_{0}^{c,e,np},c_{1}^{c,e.np}-\varepsilon_{1},c_{2}^{c,e,np}+\varepsilon_{2}\right)$
such that $U_{0}\left(C_{0}^{c,e,np}\right)=U_{0}\left(\hat{C}_{0}\right)$
and $\Pi_{0}(C_{1}^{r}\left(\hat{C}_{1}\right);\hat{C}_{1})\leq\kappa(\mbox{\ensuremath{\bar{\alpha}}})$<$\kappa\left(1\right)$.
So, any firm can make positive profits by operating as a non-profit.
Therefore, in equilibrium, consumers will borrow only from non-profit
firms. Given the construction of $\bar{U}^{np}$, firms can make nonnegative
profits while satisfying the participation constraint only if $U_{0}^{A}\leq\bar{U}^{np}$.

(b) If all firms are nonprofit, an individual firm has a strict incentive
to switch to for-profit status, and make profits in period 1. Therefore,
there must be for-profits in equilibrium, and equilibrium contracts
will be constrained by their presence. $\Square$
