\section{About Template}
We denote the
resulting  `autarky' consumption stream C_{0}^{A}$
and its associated present discounted utility by $U_{0}^{A}$.
{
 In the best of circumstances her optimal consumption
path $C_{0}^{*}$ satisfies the interior optimum conditions $u'\left(c_{0}\right)=\beta \delta (1+r) u'\left(c_{1}\right)=\beta  \delta ^2 (1+r)^2 u'\left(c_{2}\right)$
and  the budget constraint $PDV(C_{0}^{*})=PDV(Y^{0})$, yielding a corresponding optimal utility
$U_{0}^{*}$.

The  \ stream will be a subgame perfect equilibrium
of the consumption-savings game played by the series of her time-indexed
selves (each with a slightly different objective function). In the
absence of credit and savings constraints, the period 0 self must
solve the following problem: 
\[
\underset{c_{0}}{max}\left[u\left(c_{0}\right)+\beta u\left(c_{1}\left(c_{0}\right)\right)+\beta u\left(c_{2}\left(c_{0}\right)\right)\right]
\]
Since $c_{1}$and $c_{2}$ will be selected in period 1, $c_{1}$
will be larger than $c_{2}$, so period 0's optimal outcome cannot
be achieved. It should also be noted that, in anticipation of period
1's response, depending on parameter values period 0 may save \emph{more
or less} than she optimally would. So access to commitment may actually
reduce the consumer's total savings.}

The consumer's autarky utility will determine her reservation price
in her dealings with the formal bank, so it is worth describing the
values it might take. In the absence of banking, her optimal consumption
path, $C_{0}^{*}$, satisfies $u'\left(c_{0}\right)=\beta \delta (1+r) u'\left(c_{1}\right)=\beta \delta^2 (1+r)^2 u'\left(c_{2}\right)$
and $\sum_{t=0}^{2}\frac{c_{t}}{1+r}= \emph{y}=\sum_{t=0}^{2}\frac{y_{t}}{1+r}$, yielding a corresponding optimal utility
$U_{0}^{*}$.
